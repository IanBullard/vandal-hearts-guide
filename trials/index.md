## How to Access Trials

### Step 1: Obtain the Key

Each Trial requires a specific Key. Keys are obtained through different means:

- **Nova Key**: Talk to woman in Port City Minato tavern after defeating Death Ant
- **Earth Key**: Trade Banana to young man in Yuzu tavern
- **Mana Key**: Found as hidden item in Prison Fortress (Act III)
- **Chaos Key**: Trade 3 collector's treasures (Macroman, Tarot, Ramen) at Kerachi tavern
- **Logos Key**: Found in Smoking Bones Cave
- **Heaven Key**: Talk to Weird Man in Glasgow City after obtaining first 5 Prisms

### Step 2: Equip Key to Ash

Open the menu and equip the Key item to Ash Lambert (like you would equip a weapon or armor).

### Step 3: Enter Any Dojo

Visit any Dojo in any town and select "Leave"

### Step 4: Accept the Challenge

The Dojomaster will ask if you want to "Transform" - select YES

### Step 5: Complete the Battle

Fight the Trial battle and collect the Prism from the treasure chest

{: .warning }
> You MUST get the Prism from the chest before ending the battle! If you defeat all enemies without getting the Prism, you cannot retry!

## Trial Characteristics

Trials are different from normal battles:

### No Standard Experience
- You don't gain experience from attacking or defeating enemies
- You only gain experience from casting spells on party members
- Support spells (Mystic Shield, Bless Weapon) work best for grinding

### Low Gold Rewards
- Each Trial gives minimal gold (140-270G total)
- Trials are for Prisms, not money

### Ash-Scaled Difficulty
{: .label .label-red }

**CRITICAL**: Enemy levels in Trials are determined **solely by Ash's level**!

- Higher Ash level = Much harder Trials
- Lower Ash level = Easier Trials
- Other party members' levels don't matter

---

## The Ash Leveling Strategy

{: .important }
> **Keep Ash as your LOWEST level character until all Trials are complete!**

### How to Do This:

1. **Don't use Ash in battles** (when possible)
2. **Don't let Ash get the killing blow** on enemies
3. **Don't cast spells with Ash** unnecessarily
4. **Position Ash safely** in the back, away from combat

### Why This Works:

Experience in Vandal Hearts is based on how far below the "standard level" a character is. If Ash sits out battles:
- He falls behind in levels
- Other characters get stronger
- Trials become much easier
- After getting all Prisms, Ash can quickly catch up

### Exception:

In **Act III, Section 1** (Plain of Sorrow - Tower Defense), you only have 4 characters including Ash. You'll likely need to use him here, which may push him to Level 15.

### Recommended Ash Levels:

| Progress | Ash Level | Notes |
|:---------|:----------|:------|
| Acts I-II | 10-11 | Minimal usage |
| Act III (after tower defense) | 15 | Unavoidable |
| Acts IV-V | 15-16 | Keep him benched |
| After all 6 Prisms | Any | Level freely! |

## When to Do the Trials

You have flexibility on timing:

### Option 1: Do Trials Immediately (Not Recommended)
**Pros**: Get it over with
**Cons**: Party is weaker, less equipped, fewer characters

### Option 2: Save Trials for Later (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Larger party (more options)
- Better equipment available
- More money to spend on prep
- Characters have advanced to better classes

**Cons**:
- Must remember to get Keys before leaving story sections
- Ash might level accidentally

{: .note }
> Most FAQ authors recommend waiting until Act V or VI to complete earlier Trials, when you have a full party of 12 advanced characters.

### Latest Possible Timing:

- **Trials 1-5**: Anytime before starting Act VI
- **Trial 6**: Anytime before the final battle with Dolf

---

## Advancing to Vandalier

Once you have all six Prisms:

1. Ensure Ash is at least **Level 20** (Paragon class)
2. Visit any **Dojo** in any town
3. Select **Advance** (not Leave/Transform)
4. Ash will advance from Paragon to **Vandalier**

{: .label .label-purple }
**Congratulations!** Ash is now a demigod.

## Experience "Cheating" in Trials

Since you gain experience from casting spells on yourself in Trials, you can exploit this:

### Castle Ruins Method (Act II, Section 3)

This level has healing circles (restore HP/MP each turn):

1. Clear all enemies
2. Don't enter the door (triggers battle end)
3. Stand healers on healing circles
4. Cast Mystic Shield on themselves repeatedly
5. Each cast = 16-17 experience
6. Takes ~6 rounds per level
7. Repeat until desired level

After leveling healers, other characters can use Mage Oil on them for massive XP boosts.

{: .warning }
> **Don't level Ash this way if you're doing Trials!** Trial difficulty will skyrocket.
