## Strategy Guide

### Core Strategy: Patient Climb

{: .note-title }
> Endurance Test
>
> This Trial is about patience and consistency, not clever tactics. Accept the grind!

**Phase 1 - Beginning the Ascent (Rounds 1-8):**
1. **Form single-file line** along the tower wall (outside edge)
2. **Fighters in front** - highest DEF characters lead
3. **Healers in middle** - can reach front and back
4. **Archers in back** - shoot over allies' heads
5. **Advance slowly** - 1-2 spaces per turn
6. **Kill Guardians** as you encounter them (slow, easy targets)
7. **Stay against wall** - minimizes exposure to ranged attacks

**Phase 2 - Middle Climb (Rounds 9-18):**
1. **Maintain formation** - single-file against wall
2. **Prioritize Dark Mages** - use archers to snipe them ASAP
3. **Salamanders approach** - flying units, use magic or arrows
4. **Basilisks engage** - stone gaze can paralyze, heal it off
5. **Conserve MP** - don't waste big spells yet
6. **Heal after each encounter** - keep HP topped up

**Phase 3 - Final Ascent (Rounds 19-24):**
1. **More Guardians** - dispatch with physical attacks
2. **Last Dark Mages** - kill immediately with focused fire
3. **Final Salamanders** - magic or arrows
4. **Approaching chest** - should be visible now

**Phase 4 - Secure Prism (Round 25+):**
1. **Clear remaining enemies** near chest area
2. **Leave 1-2 enemies alive** at bottom of tower (insurance)
3. **Character reaches chest** - collect Logos Prism
4. **Verify prism in inventory**
5. **Clean up last enemies**
6. Victory!

## Detailed Tactics

### Party Composition

| Role | Purpose | Priority |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| **Armors/Knights** | Front-line tanks, absorb damage | Critical |
| **Healers (2+)** | Constant healing required | Critical |
| **Archers (2-3)** | Dark Mage sniping, Salamander killing | High |
| **Mages** | Salamander damage, emergency AOE | Medium |
| **Monks** | Hybrid healing/damage | Medium |

### Formation Recommendation

**Optimal Tower Climbing Formation:**
```
[Front] Fighter/Armor (Tank #1)
[2nd] Fighter/Knight (Tank #2)
[3rd] Healer/Priest (Main support)
[4th] Archer/Bowman (Ranged DPS)
[5th] Mage/Sorcerer (Spell support)
[6th] Healer/Monk (Backup healing)
[7th] Archer (Ranged DPS)
[8th] Archer (Rear guard)
```

### Target Priority

**Kill Order:**
1. **Dark Mages** (top priority - they cast damaging spells from range)
2. **Salamanders** (flying, fire attacks, moderate threat)
3. **Basilisks** (stone gaze can disable, medium threat)
4. **Guardians** (slow, low threat, kill last)

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Tactics

✓ **Wall hugging** - Stay against outside wall for cover

✓ **Single-file discipline** - Don't break formation; it's narrow!

✓ **Archer sniping** - Kill Dark Mages before they get in range

✓ **Conserve MP early** - You'll need it for 25+ rounds

✓ **Heal proactively** - Don't wait until HP is low

✓ **Slow and steady** - This isn't a race; methodical wins

✓ **Leave insurance enemy** - Don't kill all until prism secured

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

✗ **Breaking formation** - Characters get isolated and focused down

✗ **Rushing ahead** - Front-runners get swarmed without support

✗ **Ignoring Dark Mages** - They'll pelt you with spells the whole climb

✗ **Wasting MP** - Big AOE spells early means no MP for Salamanders later

✗ **Low HP tolerance** - One crit can kill; keep everyone healthy

✗ **Forgetting prism** - After 25 rounds, don't forget why you're here!

|:--------|:-------|:-------|:--------|
| Chapter 5 | Easy | High | Medium |
| Chapter 6 | Trivial | High | Easy |

{: .note }
> **Author's Opinion (Wolverine):** "Assuming you're fully equipped, this is EASY. It may be easy but it's also extremely tedious and boring! (~25 rounds worth of tedium)"

## Optimization Tips

### Speed Run Tactics (Minimize Rounds)

If you want to finish faster:

1. **Aggressive advancement** - Move 2-3 spaces per turn instead of 1
2. **AOE spells** - Use Phase Shift on Guardian clusters
3. **Flying units** - Hawknights can fly ahead to pull enemies
4. **Kill speed** - Focus-fire to one-shot enemies
5. **Skip stragglers** - Run past Guardians at bottom once prism secured

**Warning:** Aggressive tactics risk character deaths!

### Patience Tactics (Safest)

If you want zero risk:

1. **Wall hugging** - Never leave outside edge
2. **One at a time** - Bait one enemy, kill, repeat
3. **Full heal** - After every single encounter
4. **MP conservation** - Physical attacks only until final levels
5. **Insurance enemy** - Leave one Guardian alive until prism obtained

**Result:** 30-40 minutes, but guaranteed success

## Troubleshooting

### "This is taking forever!"

**Solution:** That's normal. Accept it. Put on music or a podcast.

**Alternative:** If you're overleveled (Chapter 6), you can rush more aggressively.

### "I keep getting hit by Dark Mage spells!"

**Solution:** The moment you see a Dark Mage (they're far away), have all archers fire on it every turn until dead. Don't advance until it's eliminated.

**Prevention:** Maintain archer positions at back of formation with clear lines of fire.

### "My formation keeps breaking!"

**Solution:** Move characters one at a time in order. Front moves first, then 2nd, then 3rd, etc. Don't have characters "leapfrog."

**Prevention:** Use the "End Turn" button deliberately - plan each character's move before executing.

### "I'm running out of MP!"

**Solution:** Use Mage Gems, Elixirs, or lean on physical attacks more.

**Prevention:** Don't cast big spells on Guardians (physical attacks work fine). Save MP for Salamanders and Dark Mages.
