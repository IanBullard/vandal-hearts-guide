## Overview

The **Nova Trial** is the first Trial you can access, available as early as Chapter 1, Section 5 (after defeating the Death Ant). This Trial features a **hill assault** where your party must climb a central mountain while fighting enemies on all sides.

{: .warning }
> **IMPORTANT:** Most FAQ authors recommend **waiting until Chapter 2 or later** before attempting this Trial. Your party will be better equipped, have more characters, and be at higher levels.

## Enemy Composition

The enemy count and levels scale based on **Ash's level** when you start the Trial.

### Enemy List (14 Total)

| Enemy | Count | Typical Level | HP Range | Notes |
|:------|:------|:--------------|:---------|:------|
| **Hunter Imp** | 4 | L9-28 | 63-182 | Flying archers, positioned around hill |
| **Buccaneer** | 4 | L9-28 | 70-203 | Melee fighters, medium strength |
| **War Ghost** | 2 | L9-28 | 75-217 | Flying units, magic users |
| **Sparkie** | 2 | L9-28 | 75-217 | Flying attackers |
| **Dark Golem** | 2 | L9-28 | 80-232 | Heavy defense, slow movement |

{: .important }
> **Ash Level Strategy:** If Ash is Level 9, enemies will be around Level 9 (easy). If Ash is Level 28, enemies will be Level 28 (hard). Keep Ash underleveled for easier Trials!

## Treasure

### Chests

- **Nova Prism** - Located on the **ally side** of the hill (must collect!)

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** You MUST collect the Nova Prism from the chest **before** defeating all enemies! If you win the battle without getting the Prism, you cannot retry this Trial, and you'll be permanently locked out of the Vandalier class!

## Strategy Guide

### Option 1: General Strategy (Syonyx)

{: .note-title }
> Flexible Approach
>
> This strategy emphasizes player choice and adapts to your party composition.

**Core Tactics:**
1. **Split your party** into two groups (one for each side of the hill)
2. **Climb simultaneously** up the east and west paths
3. **Get the Nova Prism chest** as you climb on the ally side
4. **Reach the top first** to gain the high ground advantage
5. **Use archers to counter enemy flyers** (can target them by turn 3)
6. **Stay close to walls** to avoid enemy archer fire
7. **Pummel from above** once you control the hilltop

**Class Recommendations:**
- **Archers/Airmen**: Essential for countering flying enemies
- **Mages**: Spells like Dark Star are effective against groups
- **Healers**: Keep them in the middle, protected by fighters
- **Fighters**: Lead the charge, tank damage

### Option 2: Perfect Clear Strategy (Wolverine)

{: .warning }
> Hardcore Difficulty
>
> Wolverine attempted this at Chapter 1 and described it as "6 solid hours of hell." Only for masochists!

**If You Insist on Attempting at Chapter 1:**

**Phase 1 - Third Shelf Positioning (Turns 6-7):**
- Move your party to the **middle of the 3rd shelf** (elevation level)
- Wait for enemies to come to you

**Phase 2 - Flying Enemy Elimination:**
- **Priority:** Sparkies and War Ghosts
- Use **Dark Star** (Eleni) + physical attacks on first Sparkie
- Use **arrows** + physical attacks on second Sparkie
- Next round: **Arrows on War Ghosts**, fighters clean up
- Save mana for later phases!

**Phase 3 - Race to Top:**
- After eliminating flyers, **race to the hilltop**
- **Hug the walls** to minimize archer exposure
- **GRAB THE NOVA PRISM** chest on the way up!

**Phase 4 - Hilltop Defense:**
- **Line up everyone at the top**
- Use **Eleni's Dark Star** on Hunter Imps and clustered enemies
- **Reserve one Dark Star for EACH Dark Golem** (critical!)
- Have fighters engage Hunter Imps in melee
- Use arrows on wounded golems
- **"Teeter back and forth"** on the hilltop to control enemy approaches
- Split up the Buccaneers with focused fire

{: .important }
> **Save Magic:** Reserve Dark Star casts specifically for the Dark Golems. They have high defense and are very difficult to kill with physical attacks at Chapter 1 power levels.

---

### Option 3: Delayed Strategy (Recommended)

{: .note-title }
> Smart Approach
>
> Wait until Chapter 2+ when you have more characters and better equipment.

**Why Wait?**
- Full party of 8+ characters instead of 6-7
- Access to Iron/Steel equipment
- Advanced job classes (Swordsman, Bowman, etc.)
- Higher levels = faster kills
- More spells and MP available

**When to Do It:**
- **Minimum:** Start of Chapter 2 (after recruiting Dolan)
- **Recommended:** Mid-Chapter 2 or later
- **Optimal:** Chapters 4-6 with full party and endgame gear

**At Higher Levels:**
- Enemies scale with Ash but become relatively easier
- Their special abilities don't scale well
- Battle becomes "absurdly easy" (Syonyx)
- Still challenging enough to be fun

## Tips & Tricks

### General Combat Tips

✓ **Flying units counter flying units** - Use your Airmen against enemy Sparkies and War Ghosts

✓ **Wall hugging** - Stay next to hill walls to break line of sight from enemy archers

✓ **High ground advantage** - Archers and mages get better range from elevation

✓ **Golem priority** - Dark Golems are tough but slow; isolate and magic them

✓ **Spell EXP** - If you want to grind experience, cast Mystic Shield on your own characters

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

✗ **Forgetting the Prism** - Battle ends immediately when last enemy dies; get chest first!

✗ **Splitting up too much** - Groups of 2-3 are ideal; lone characters get swarmed

✗ **Wasting MP early** - Save powerful spells for the toughest enemies (Golems)

✗ **Ignoring flyers** - Flying enemies can bypass your formation; prioritize them

✗ **Fighting uphill** - Let enemies come to you when possible; uphill attacks are harder

---

## Rewards

### Battle End
- **140G** (10G × 14 enemies)
- **Nova Prism** (from chest, required for Vandalier)

### Progress
- ✓ **1 of 6 Trials complete**
- ✓ Nova Key consumed (Trial cannot be replayed)
- ✓ Nova Prism added to inventory

{: .note }
> After completing the Nova Trial, you can still replay it by NOT collecting the Prism. This is useful for spell EXP grinding, but you won't get another Prism if you already have it.
