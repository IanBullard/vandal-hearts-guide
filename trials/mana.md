## Overview

The **Mana Trial** is the third Trial of Toroah, featuring a unique challenge: **19 Mimic chests and only 1 real treasure**. This Trial tests your ability to explore systematically while managing combat threats.

{: .note }
> **Unique Mechanic:** Unlike other Trials, combat is minimal. The real challenge is finding the correct chest among 20 options without accidentally ending the battle early!

---

## How to Access

### Step 1: Get the Mana Key

During **Chapter 3, Section 7** (Prison Yard - Jailbreak Part 2):
1. Hit the **switch** to lower the western wall
2. Navigate to the **NW corner** of the lowered area
3. Search the **cracked hole** in the western wall
4. Collect the **Mana Key** hidden item

{: .danger }
> **MISSABLE:** The Mana Key can ONLY be found during Chapter 3, Section 7! You must collect it before defeating Dumas and finishing the battle. If you miss it, you cannot unlock Vandalier!

{: .warning }
> **Timing Critical:** Get the Mana Key BEFORE finishing the Dumas boss fight. Send an Archer or Hawknight to collect it while others handle combat.

### Step 2: Start the Trial

1. Have **Ash equip the Mana Key** as an item
2. Visit **any Dojo** in any town (earliest: Chapter 4)
3. Try to **Leave** the Dojo
4. The Dojomaster will notice the key and offer to start the Trial
5. Select **"Transform"** to begin

## Battle Conditions

- **Victory:** Destruction of all enemies
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash Lambert
- **Gold Reward:** 200G (10G × 20 enemies)

| **Mimic** | 19 | L18-28 | 123-180 | **HIDDEN IN CHESTS!** |

{: .danger }

### The Fake Chests

- **19 Mimic Chests** - Scattered across the map, attacking when opened

{: .danger }

## Strategy Guide

### Core Strategy: Insurance Enemy Method

{: .important }
> **Golden Rule:** NEVER kill all visible enemies until you have the Mana Prism secured!

**Phase 1 - Brigand Control:**
1. Locate the **Brigand** (only visible enemy)
2. **Cast Spellbind** on him immediately
3. **DO NOT KILL HIM!** - He's your insurance enemy
4. Refresh Spellbind if it wears off
5. Keep him paralyzed throughout the battle

{: .note }
> The Brigand serves as "insurance" - as long as he's alive, you can't accidentally end the battle. Dark Golems are easier to paralyze according to some sources, but this trial only has one Brigand.

**Phase 2 - Split Party Rush:**
1. **Split party** in multiple directions (3-4 groups)
2. Have a **Hawknight/Sky Lord rush SE corner** directly (fastest movement)
3. Other groups open chests methodically
4. **Open Mimic chests and kill Mimics** as you go
5. Leave a path for the SE rush

**Phase 3 - Secure the Prism:**
1. Hawknight reaches **SE corner chest (22,1)**
2. **Open and collect Mana Prism**
3. Verify prism is in inventory
4. NOW it's safe to kill all remaining enemies

**Phase 4 - Cleanup:**
1. Kill remaining Mimics systematically
2. Kill the paralyzed Brigand last
3. Battle ends when all enemies defeated

## Detailed Tactics

### Recommended Party Setup

| Role | Purpose | Priority |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| **Hawknight/Sky Lord** | SE corner rush (best mobility) | Critical |
| **Mage** | Spellbind caster (paralyze Brigand) | Critical |
| **Fighters** | Mimic killers (open chests safely) | High |
| **Archers** | Range support (assist Mimic kills) | Medium |
| **Healers** | Support (Mimics hit hard) | Medium |

### Opening Sequence

**Turn 1:**
1. **Identify Brigand location**
2. **Mage casts Spellbind** on Brigand
3. **Hawknight moves toward SE corner** (maximum movement)
4. **Other units spread out** toward nearest chests

**Turn 2:**
1. Check **Brigand still paralyzed** (refresh if needed)
2. **Hawknight continues SE** (approaching target chest)
3. **Other units open first Mimics** (tank takes point, opens chest)
4. **Kill opened Mimics** with focused fire

**Turn 3+:**
1. **Hawknight reaches SE corner** - opens chest - **GETS MANA PRISM**
2. Other units continue **opening and killing Mimics**
3. Work systematically - don't rush now that prism is secure

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Tactics

✓ **Paralyze early** - Spellbind the Brigand on Turn 1, never kill him until the end

✓ **Hawknight rushes** - Flying unit with maximum MOVE reaches SE fastest

✓ **Tank opens chests** - High-DEF character opens Mimic chests, others attack

✓ **Spread out systematically** - Cover different areas to open many chests quickly

✓ **SE corner priority** - That's the ONLY real chest; everything else is a Mimic

✓ **Verification** - Check inventory to confirm Mana Prism obtained before final kills

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

✗ **Killing Brigand early** - You need him alive until prism is secured!

✗ **Opening chests randomly** - Go straight to SE corner first!

✗ **Forgetting Spellbind refresh** - Paralysis wears off; keep the Brigand locked down

✗ **Not confirming prism** - Battle ends FAST; make sure you have it first

✗ **Weak unit opens chests** - Mimics hit hard; use tanks to spring traps

✗ **Bunching up** - Spread out to open multiple chests per turn efficiently

## Mimic Combat Tips

### Mimic Characteristics

- **Level:** Scales with Ash (typically L18-28)
- **HP:** 123-180 HP depending on level
- **Attack:** Physical melee, moderate-high damage
- **Behavior:** Stationary until chest opened, then attacks

### How to Fight Mimics Safely

1. **Tank opens** - Character with highest DEF/HP opens chest
2. **Surround position** - Have 2-3 attackers adjacent to chest location
3. **Spring trap** - Tank opens chest, Mimic spawns and attacks
4. **Immediate retaliation** - Surrounding units kill Mimic on their turns
5. **Heal if needed** - Mimics can deal 30-50 damage

### Efficient Mimic Clearing

- **2-hit kills:** Most Mimics die in 2 physical attacks or 1 spell
- **Dark Star effective:** Mage AOE spells work well if Mimics cluster
- **Archers useful:** Finish wounded Mimics from range
- **Don't waste MP:** Physical attacks work fine; save spells for later Trials

## Treasure Chest Locations

{: .note }
> **Pro Tip:** You don't need to open every chest! Only the SE corner chest matters. Open others for gold/EXP, but once you have the Prism, you can end the battle.

### The Important One

- **SE Corner (22,1):** Mana Prism ← **THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS**

### The Fake Ones (19 Mimics)

All other chests scattered across the map contain Mimics. Open for experience and gold, but they're not required.

---

## Recommended Timing

### When to Attempt

**Minimum Level:**
- Ash Level 15+ (makes Mimics Level 15+)
- Party at Level 14-16 range

**Recommended Timing:**
- **Early:** Chapter 4 immediately (you just got the key)
- **Mid:** Chapter 4-5 with advanced equipment
- **Late:** Chapter 6 (trivially easy with endgame gear)

**Equipment Recommendations:**
- **Weapons:** Steel-tier minimum
- **Armor:** Scale Mail or better
- **Helms:** Steel Helm for tanks

### Difficulty by Chapter

| Chapter | Difficulty | Notes |
|:--------|:-----------|:------|
| Chapter 4 | Easy | Straightforward if you know the puzzle |
| Chapter 5+ | Trivial | Overgeared for the challenge |

{: .note }
> This Trial is more **puzzle than combat**. Once you know the SE corner trick, difficulty is minimal regardless of when you attempt it.
