## Enemy Composition

{: .important }
> **ALL GOLEMS:** Every enemy in this Trial is a golem! Bring magic damage - physical attacks are weak against golem defense.

### Enemy List (18 Total)

| Enemy | Count | Typical Level | HP | Notes |
|:------|:------|:--------------|:---|:------|
| **Gold Golem** | 8 | L21-28 | 176-230 | Highest HP, slowest |
| **Dark Golem** | 7 | L21-28 | 176-230 | Strong physical attacks |
| **Clay Golem** | 3 | L21-28 | 168-220 | Easiest to paralyze |

---

## Treasure

### Chests

- **Chaos Prism** - Located on an elevated platform accessible only via box bridge

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** You MUST build a 3-box bridge to reach the Chaos Prism! You MUST collect it BEFORE defeating all enemies!

---

## Map Layout

The Chaos Trial features a **multi-tiered arena** with aqueduct channels:

```
[Tier 3 - Highest]
    [Box 3]    [CHAOS PRISM on platform]

[Tier 2 - Middle]
    [Box 2]    [Golems]
        ↓ Aqueduct

[Tier 1 - Ground]
    [Box 1]    [Most Golems]

[Ally Start]
```

**Key Features:**
- **3 elevation tiers** (ground, middle, top)
- **3 pushable boxes** (one per tier)
- **Aqueduct channels** that boxes can be pushed through
- **Elevated chest platform** requiring stacked boxes to reach
- **18 golems** scattered across all three tiers

---

## The Box Puzzle Explained

### Objective

Stack all 3 boxes to create a "bridge" that allows you to reach the elevated Chaos Prism platform.

### Box Mechanics

- **Boxes can be PUSHED** by standing behind them and moving forward
- **Boxes move 1 space** per push
- **Boxes fall through aqueducts** to lower tiers when pushed into them
- **Boxes can be TRAPPED** in corners (FAIL STATE!)
- **Cannot pull boxes** - only push!

### Critical Rules

✓ **Boxes must be stacked in order:** Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3

✓ **Aqueducts drop boxes down levels**

✓ **Walls block box movement**

✗ **NEVER corner a box** - you cannot undo it!

✗ **Don't push boxes across middle** - they must go around perimeter

---

## Strategy Guide

### Phase 1: Golem Management

**Objective:** Clear most golems while leaving 3 alive as "timers"

**Tactics:**
1. **Use Area Spells** (Phase Shift, Dark Star, Salamander) on golem clusters
2. **Magic damage** >> Physical damage (golems have high DEF)
3. Clear **ground tier (Tier 1)** completely
4. Clear **middle tier (Tier 2)** completely
5. **LEAVE 3 GOLEMS ON TOP TIER (Tier 3)** alive - don't attack them!

{: .important }
> **Why Leave 3 Golems?** You need time to solve the box puzzle. If you kill all enemies, the battle ends immediately. The 3 golems on top tier act as "timers" giving you unlimited turns to solve the puzzle.

**Recommended Golem Killers:**
- **Mages/Sorcerers:** Phase Shift, Salamander (AOE spells)
- **Monks/Ninjas:** Mixed attacks
- **Priests with Attack Spells:** Roman Fire
- **Archers:** Physical backup

**Paralyze Option:**
- Dark Golems and Clay Golems can be paralyzed with Spellbind
- Keep them locked down while solving puzzle
- They'll eventually break free, so work efficiently

---

### Phase 2: The Box Puzzle Solution

{: .warning }
> **WARNING:** This is where most players fail! Follow these steps EXACTLY or you may trap boxes and need to restart!

#### Box 1 (Tier 1 - Ground Level)

**Objective:** Position Box 1 along the south wall under the elevated platform

**Steps:**
1. **Clear all ground-level golems first**
2. Find Box 1 on ground tier (Tier 1)
3. Push Box 1 to the **south wall** where it juts out to the west one block
4. Position it **directly under the middle tier access point**
5. **This creates a "step" for characters to climb to Tier 2**

**Critical Points:**
- Don't push it into a corner!
- Position must be along south wall
- Must line up with the aqueduct path above

#### Box 2 (Tier 2 - Middle Level)

**Objective:** Push Box 2 through aqueduct to land on Box 1

**Steps:**
1. **Characters climb to Tier 2** using Box 1 as a step
2. Clear all middle-tier golems
3. Locate Box 2 on middle tier
4. **Push Box 2 south** once
5. **Get behind Box 2** and push it **west**
6. Push it **under the bridge** (through the aqueduct)
7. Continue pushing until it's **lined up with the chest platform**
8. **Push through aqueduct** - Box 2 falls onto Box 1

{: .warning }
> **Key Trick:** Box 2 must go "ALL the way around by chest" - push it along the perimeter, not straight across the middle!

#### Box 3 (Tier 3 - Top Level)

**Objective:** Push Box 3 through aqueduct to land on Box 2

**Steps:**
1. **Send 1-2 characters to Tier 3** (preferably with healing - Ash recommended)
2. **Don't attack the 3 remaining golems!** (need them alive)
3. If golems attack, heal and dodge
4. Locate Box 3 on top tier
5. **Push Box 3 north** once
6. **Push through archway** toward the aqueduct
7. **Push Box 3 through aqueduct** - it falls onto Box 2

**Result:** All 3 boxes now stacked! You have a "bridge" to the Chaos Prism platform!

---

### Phase 3: Get the Prism

1. **Character climbs the 3-box stack**
2. **Cross to elevated platform**
3. **Open chest and collect Chaos Prism**
4. **Verify prism in inventory**

---

### Phase 4: Cleanup

1. NOW attack the 3 remaining golems on Tier 3
2. Kill all remaining enemies
3. Battle ends when last golem defeated

## Detailed Tactics

### Party Composition

| Role | Purpose | Priority |
|:-----|:--------|:---------|
| **Mages (multiple)** | AOE golem clearing (Phase Shift!) | Critical |
| **Healers** | Support during puzzle solving | High |
| **Monks** | Hybrid damage/support | Medium |
| **Box Pushers** | Any physical class (Fighters, Knights) | Medium |
| **Scouts** | 1-2 for Tier 3 (heal capable preferred) | Medium |

### Spell Recommendations

**Most Effective:**
- **Phase Shift** (Mage AOE) - Hits multiple golems, massive damage
- **Salamander** (Mage) - Fire AOE, great against golems
- **Spellbind** (Mage/Monk) - Paralyze troublesome golems
- **Healing spells** - Keep puzzle solvers alive

**Less Effective:**
- Physical attacks (golems have high DEF)
- Single-target spells (inefficient against 18 enemies)

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Tactics

✓ **Magic is king** - Golem DEF is high; magic ignores it

✓ **Phase Shift spam** - Best spell for this Trial; hits groups of 3-4 golems

✓ **Leave 3 alive** - Top-tier golems are your "timer" insurance

✓ **Perimeter pushing** - Move boxes around edges, not across center

✓ **Healer on Tier 3** - Character solving Box 3 puzzle needs self-healing

✓ **Save frequently** - If puzzle fails, reload instead of restarting Trial

✓ **Spellbind backup** - Paralyze golems if they interfere with puzzle

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

✗ **Killing all golems early** - Battle ends; you can't solve puzzle!

✗ **Cornering boxes** - FAIL STATE; must restart

✗ **Pushing boxes straight across** - They get trapped!

✗ **No magic users** - Physical attacks take forever on golems

✗ **Rushing Box 3** - Take your time; golems can't reach the platform

✗ **Forgetting prism** - Climb stack, get prism BEFORE killing last golems!

## Recommended Timing

### When to Attempt

**Minimum Level:**
- Ash Level 18+ (makes golems Level 18-21)
- Party at Level 17-20 range

**Recommended Timing:**
- **Earliest:** End of Chapter 4 (after getting Ramen, trading for key)
- **Mid:** Chapter 5 with Master-tier equipment
- **Late:** Chapter 6 (puzzle is same difficulty, combat trivial)

**Equipment Recommendations:**
- **Weapons:** Great-tier minimum, Master-tier preferred
- **Armor:** Kevlar/Great Armor for melee
- **Accessories:** Mage Gems (MP restoration for spells)

### Difficulty by Chapter

| Chapter | Combat | Puzzle | Overall |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|:--------|
| Chapter 4 | Hard | Hard | Very Hard |
| Chapter 5 | Medium | Hard | Hard |
| Chapter 6 | Easy | Hard | Medium |

{: .note }
> **Puzzle Difficulty Never Changes:** The box puzzle is equally challenging regardless of when you attempt it. Only the golem combat gets easier with levels/gear.

## Troubleshooting

### "I trapped a box in a corner!"

**Solution:** Reload your last save. There's no way to undo a trapped box.

**Prevention:** Always push boxes around the perimeter walls, never straight across the middle area.

### "I killed all the golems before solving the puzzle!"

**Solution:** Restart the Trial. Battle ends when last enemy dies.

**Prevention:** Leave 3 golems on Tier 3 completely untouched until puzzle is solved.

### "The golems keep attacking my puzzle solver!"

**Solution:** Use Spellbind to paralyze them, or have a healer heal each turn.

**Prevention:** Send a self-sufficient character to Tier 3 (Hero Ash is ideal with healing items).

### "I can't figure out where to push the boxes!"

**Solution:** Follow the step-by-step in Phase 2 above exactly.

**Key Principle:** Boxes must go "around" the map along perimeter walls, using aqueducts to drop down levels.
