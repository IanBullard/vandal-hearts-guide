## Strategy Guide

### Core Strategy: Tight Phalanx Formation

{: .note-title }
> United We Stand
>
> With 28 elite enemies, your only hope is maintaining formation discipline!

**Phase 1 - Initial Deployment:**
1. **Form tight phalanx** - all characters close together
2. **Best fighters in front** (Ash, Armors, Knights)
3. **Healers in center** - protected, can reach everyone
4. **Archers in back** - shoot over front line
5. **Mages on flanks** - spell support

**Formation Example:**
```
        [Archer] [Archer]
    [Mage]  [Healer]  [Mage]
[Fighter] [Ash] [Fighter] [Fighter]
    [Armor] [Knight] [Armor]
```

**Phase 2 - Priority Target Elimination:**

**Target Priority (CRITICAL):**
1. **Dark Mages** (TOP PRIORITY - spell damage from range)
2. **Sabrina** (high mobility, dangerous)
3. **Dumas** (high HP, spell user)
4. **Kurtz** (healing abilities, persistent)
5. **Zoot/Lando** (mobility threats)
6. **Dallas** (tough but slow)
7. **Evil Statues** (LEAVE 1 ALIVE until chest secured!)

**Phase 3 - Methodical Advancement:**
1. **Let enemies come to you** when possible
2. **Focus-fire** - kill one enemy per turn
3. **Heal after every round** - everyone at high HP
4. **Advance slowly** toward chest area
5. **Maintain formation** - never let it break!

**Phase 4 - Secure the Prism:**
1. **Eliminate enemies near chest**
2. **Keep 1-2 Evil Statues alive** (insurance)
3. **Character reaches chest behind Evil Statue**
4. **Collect Heaven Prism**
5. **Verify prism in inventory**

**Phase 5 - Cleanup:**
1. Kill remaining Evil Statues
2. Finish off any stragglers
3. Victory and congratulations!

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Tactics

✓ **Formation discipline** - This is THE most important factor

✓ **Kill Dark Mages first** - Always, without exception

✓ **Focus-fire** - One enemy dead per turn, minimum

✓ **Heal proactively** - Keep everyone above 75% HP

✓ **Let them come** - Defensive positioning favors you

✓ **AOE spells** - Phase Shift, Salamander on clusters

✓ **Insurance enemies** - Leave Evil Statues until prism secured

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

✗ **Spreading out** - Characters get isolated and overwhelmed

✗ **Ignoring Dark Mages** - They'll devastate your formation

✗ **Low HP tolerance** - One critical hit can kill

✗ **Killing all enemies early** - Battle ends before chest collected!

✗ **Breaking formation** - This is how you lose

✗ **Underestimating numbers** - 28 elite enemies is a LOT

## Recommended Party Setup

### Ideal 12-Character Party

| Character | Class | Role | Priority |
|:----------|:------|:-----|:---------|
| **Ash** | Paragon/Hero | Front-line tank/DPS | Critical |
| **Clint** | Duelist/Knight | Front-line fighter | High |
| **Diego** | Dragoon/Armor | Front-line tank | High |
| **Dolan** | Duelist/Knight | Front-line fighter | High |
