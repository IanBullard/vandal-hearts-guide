## Overview

The **Earth Trial** (called "Ice Trial" in some versions) is the second Trial of Toroah, available in Chapter 2. This Trial features **14 archer-class enemies** exclusively, making it a unique test of ranged combat strategy.

{: .note }
> **Translation Note:** The game displays "ICE PRISM" in the U/C (US/Canadian) version, but this is actually the **Earth Prism**. The naming matches the Earth Key used to access the trial.

---

## How to Access

### Step 1: Find the Banana

During **Chapter 2, Section 3** (Loris Beach):
1. Navigate to the **cross-shaped poison swamp** (center of map)
2. Send a character to the **center of the cross**

4. Give him the **Banana**

- **Gold Reward:** ~160-180G (10G per enemy)
- **Experience:** Only from curative/supportive spells (no combat EXP)

## Enemy Composition

{: .important }
> **ALL ARCHERS:** Every single enemy in this Trial is an archer-class unit! This makes flying units extremely vulnerable but also means you can use ranged units effectively.

### Enemy List (14-16 Total)

| Enemy | Count | Typical Level | HP Range | Notes |
|:------|:------|:--------------|:---------|:------|
| **Hunter** | 2-3 | L11-28 | 75-180 | Ground archers, standard range |
| **Hunter Imp** | 2-3 | L11-28 | 75-182 | Flying archers, mobile |
| **Shooter Imp** | 3 | L11-28 | 75-180 | Flying archers, enhanced range |
| **Corsair** | 3 | L11-28 | 75-203 | Ground archers, better equipment |
| **Grenadier** | 2 | L11-28 | 80-200 | Explosive attacks, area damage |
| **Crimson Archer** | 2 | L11-28 | 85-217 | Elite archers, high damage |

{: .note }
> Enemy levels scale with Ash's level. The lower Ash's level, the easier this Trial becomes.

## Treasure

### Chests

- **Earth Prism** (displayed as "Ice Prism") - Location varies by map layout

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** You MUST collect the Earth Prism from the chest **before** defeating all enemies! If you win the battle without getting the Prism, you cannot retry this Trial!

---

## Map Layout

The Earth Trial features a gradual advancement map where enemy strength increases as you move forward.

**Key Features:**
- **Linear progression** from starting point toward chest
- **Enemies arranged in waves** - weakest first, strongest at the end
- **Minimal cover** - open battlefield favors ranged combat
- **No elevation** - flat terrain

## Strategy Guide

### General Strategy (Syonyx)

{: .note-title }
> Defensive Tactics
>
> This strategy emphasizes careful advancement and front-line protection.

**Core Tactics:**
1. **Keep Airmen back** - All enemies are archers, so flying units are in extreme danger
2. **Advance slowly** - Don't rush; let enemies come to you when possible
3. **Front-line shield** - Characters with high physical defense take point
4. **Healers within reach** - Constant healing required
5. **Wave combat** - Enemy strength increases as you advance forward

**Class Priorities:**

✓ **Armors/Knights (Heavy)**: Best physical defense, tank arrows effectively

✓ **Archers (Ground)**: Counter-attack at range without vulnerability

✓ **Mages**: Offensive spells bypass archer defense

✓ **Priests**: Constant healing and support required

✗ **Airmen/Hawknights**: AVOID! Flying units are extremely vulnerable to archer fire

### Perfect Clear Strategy (Wolverine)

{: .note-title }
> Sweep and Clear
>
> Systematic elimination with coordinated advancement.

**Phase 1 - Initial Contact:**
1. **Split party** into two groups (maintain overlap for support)
2. **Archers and spellcasters lead** the ranged assault
3. Keep **fighters in front** as arrow shields
4. Advance gradually, maintaining formation

**Phase 2 - Sweep to Chest:**
1. Move forward in **coordinated waves**
2. **Prioritize Crimson Archers and Grenadiers** - highest damage enemies
3. Use **area spells** (Dark Star, etc.) on clustered enemies
4. Let your archers and mages do most of the work

**Phase 3 - Finish:**
1. **Get the Earth Prism** from the chest before defeating last enemies
2. Clean up remaining stragglers
3. Use ranged attacks to finish wounded enemies safely

{: .important }
> **Key Tactics:** Your archers and spellcasters will carry this battle. Physical fighters serve primarily as tanks to absorb arrows and protect your ranged damage dealers.

## Tips & Tricks

### Effective Tactics

✓ **Armor matters** - High DEF gear significantly reduces arrow damage

✓ **Ranged supremacy** - This is a pure archer duel; bring your best bows and spells

✓ **Formation discipline** - Tight formation keeps everyone in healing range

✓ **Shields up front** - Heavily armored units block arrows for softer targets

✓ **Target priority** - Kill Crimson Archers and Grenadiers first (highest threat)

✓ **Spell efficiency** - Use area spells when enemies cluster

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

✗ **Using Airmen** - Flying units get shredded by concentrated archer fire

✗ **Spreading out** - Isolated units get focused down quickly

✗ **Rushing forward** - Advance slowly and methodically

✗ **Ignoring Grenadiers** - Their explosive attacks hit multiple characters

✗ **Forgetting the Prism** - Always grab the chest before killing the last enemy!

✗ **Low HP healing** - Heal preemptively; archer damage adds up fast

## Timing Recommendations

### When to Attempt

**Minimum Level:**
- Ash Level 11+ (makes enemies Level 11+)
- Party at Level 10-12 range

**Recommended Timing:**
- **Early:** End of Chapter 2 (after recruiting Sara, Dolan, Amon)
- **Mid:** Chapter 3-4 with advanced classes
- **Late:** Chapters 5-6 with endgame gear (becomes very easy)

**Equipment Recommendations:**
- **Weapons:** Iron Bow minimum, Steel Bow preferred
- **Armor:** Scale Mail or better for tanks
- **Helms:** Iron Helm minimum for front-line

### Difficulty by Chapter

| Chapter | Difficulty | Notes |
|:--------|:-----------|:------|
| Chapter 2 | Hard | Limited party, basic equipment |
| Chapter 3 | Medium | Advanced classes available |
| Chapter 4+ | Easy | Full party, superior gear, enemy abilities don't scale |

{: .note }
> According to Syonyx, waiting until higher levels makes earlier Trials "absurdly easy" because enemy special abilities don't scale well with level increases.
