{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL WARNING:** If you defeat ALL enemies before collecting the MANA PRISM, the battle ends and you lose access to the prism forever! You CANNOT retry this Trial!

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** High - "Most Mimic-heavy Trial"

This is the most dangerous Trial for getting trapped. 19 of 20 chests contain aggressive Mimic monsters. The challenge is navigating the maze, fighting Mimics, and collecting the prism before running out of enemies.

#### Core Strategy: Insurance Enemy Method

**Critical Rule:** **Keep at least 1 enemy alive** until you have the MANA PRISM!

**Recommended Insurance Enemy:**
- **Brigand** (boss) - Keep him alive as "insurance"
- Don't kill him until prism is secured
- If you accidentally open too many Mimic chests early, keep 1 Mimic alive

#### Turn-by-Turn Execution

**Turn 1 - Split Party Formation:**

**Why Split:**
- Map has chests distributed across entire field
- Need to open chests to progress (Mimics block paths)
- Faster collection if party spreads out
- Each group can handle Mimics as encountered

**Group Assignments:**

**Group 1 - SE Mission (Priority!):**
- **Diego** (if Hawknight/Sky Lord) or fastest ranged unit
- **Purpose:** Rush directly to **(22,1)** for MANA PRISM
- **Support:** 1 healer if possible

**Group 2 - West Side:**
- 3-4 characters
- Clear west column of chests
- Fight Mimics as encountered

**Group 3 - Center:**
- 3-4 characters
- Clear center columns
- Engage Brigand but DON'T KILL

**Group 4 - East Side:**
- Remaining characters
- Support SE mission group
- Clear eastern chests

**Turn 2-4 - Chest Opening & Mimic Combat:**

**Mimic Engagement Tactics:**
1. **One chest at a time** - Don't open multiple simultaneously
2. **Gang up** - 2-3 characters per Mimic
3. **Ranged attacks** - Archers fire from safety
4. **AOE magic** - Phase Shift if multiple Mimics grouped

**Mimic Stats (at Level 18):**
- 123 HP
- High agility (~76)
- Physical attacks
- Can kill weakened characters

**Combat Tips:**
- Mimics appear immediately when chest opened
- They're aggressive and attack nearest character
- Heal after each Mimic fight
- Don't let characters get surrounded

**Turn 3-5 - SE Corner Rush:**

**Diego's Mission (or equivalent fast unit):**
1. Make **direct path** to SE corner
2. Open chests in the way (fight resulting Mimics)
3. Allies support by killing Mimics behind him
4. Reach **(22,1)** as fast as possible
5. **Open chest → MANA PRISM**
6. **VERIFY IT'S IN INVENTORY!**

**Why Hawknight/Sky Lord Ideal:**
- Flying movement ignores terrain
- Can fly directly over obstacles
- Fastest route to SE corner
- Can escape if surrounded

**Turn 5-8 - Cleanup:**

**After Securing Prism:**
1. **Verify MANA PRISM in inventory** (critical!)
2. Continue opening remaining chests if desired (EXP/gold)
3. Kill Brigand when ready
4. Finish any remaining Mimics
5. Battle ends when all enemies dead

#### Alternative Strategy: Conservative Clear

For players who want safer approach:

**Phase 1 - Establish Base:**
1. Stay grouped at start
2. Open nearest chests one at a time
3. Kill each Mimic before opening next
4. Create "cleared zone"

**Phase 2 - Systematic Progression:**
1. Advance as group toward SE
2. Clear one column at a time
3. Keep Brigand away (don't engage)
4. Slow but safe

**Phase 3 - Final Sprint:**
1. When close to SE, send fast unit
2. Rush to (22,1)
3. Get prism
4. Return to group safety

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Killing All Enemies Too Fast:**
- Opening all chests without planning
- Forgetting to get prism before last kill
- Battle ends = prism lost forever

**❌ Getting Overwhelmed:**
- Opening multiple chests at once
- 4-5 Mimics surrounding party
- Can't reach SE corner

**❌ Ignoring the Brigand:**
- Killing him early removes insurance
- If you misjudge Mimic count, could lose prism access

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Keep Brigand alive as insurance
- Rush SE corner early with fast unit
- Get prism first, clear Mimics second
- Verify prism in inventory before finishing

### Post-Trial

**Reward:**
- **MANA PRISM** (3/6 Prisms for Vandalier)
- 200 G
- Minimal EXP (Mimics scale with Ash)

**Progress:**
- ✅ Nova Prism (Trial #1)
- ✅ Earth Prism (Trial #2)
- ✅ **Mana Prism (Trial #3)** ← Just obtained!
- ⬜ Chaos Prism (Trial #4 - can get this Act after collecting RAMEN)
- ⬜ Logos Prism (Trial #5 - Act 5)
- ⬜ Heaven Prism (Trial #6 - Act 6)

**3 of 6 Prisms obtained!**

## Battle 4.1: Khanos City - Four Generals Ambush

**Recommended Level:** 16
**Map Size:** 20×28 grid
**Victory Condition:** Arrival at village exit
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .danger }
> **4 BOSS BATTLE:** Kane, Dallas, Kurtz, and Sabina all attack at once! Each has healing abilities. This is one of the toughest battles in the game.

{: .important }
> **BEFORE BATTLE:** Make sure you're FULLY EQUIPPED! Steel armor minimum, Great-tier ideal. **After this battle, Khanos City becomes inaccessible** - you cannot return to shop!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| **Kane Assassin** (Boss) | 1 | 22 | 161 | 91 | 79 | 79 | HEALING CIRCLE(2) R5 |
| **Sabina Valkyrie** (Boss) | 1 | 18 | 119 | 66 | 53 | 63 | HYPER HEALING R8 |

| C. Knight (Kn) | 10 | 19 | 140 | 80 | 69 | 69 | None |
| C. Armor (Ar) | 2 | 19 | 160 | 90 | 97 | 52 | None |
| C. Hawk (Ai) | 2 | 18 | 142 | 93 | 73 | 70 | None |

**Total Gold:** 15,840 G

**Total Enemies:** 17 (4 bosses + 13 regular units)

### Boss Analysis

**Kane Assassin:**
- Highest level boss (22)
- HEALING CIRCLE(2) can heal allies in area
- High AT and AGL = dangerous
- Starts in SE with large entourage
- May not advance until late battle

**Sabina Valkyrie:**
- HYPER HEALING (range 8!) = extreme support range
- Can heal from far distance
- Moderate stats but annoying healing
- Starts in SW with group

**Dallas Greatarmor:**
- Heaviest armor (DF 107!)
- EXTRA HEALING (self-heal)
- Highest HP (176)
- Weak to magic (Armor class)
- **Can OHKO characters** (author reports 128 damage hit!)
- Starts in NW (closest to party)

**Kurtz War Master:**
- DAGGER STORM - AOE attack hitting all adjacent tiles
- ~70 damage to surrounding targets
- Highest AGL (88) = acts often
- Monk class = balanced stats
- Starts in NE

{: .danger }
> **Healing Nightmare:** All 4 bosses can heal! Focus-fire one at a time or they'll outheal your damage.

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (2):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Value/Use |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:----------|
| East area | (18,15) | HOLY H2O | **Heals ALL allies fully, any range!** |
| Northeast | (18,21) | AURA GEM | Magic attack +8 accessory |

**Hidden Items (1):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|
| (13,26) | GOLD AXE | NE area, tile marked by 3 holes/dimples |

{: .important }
> **Holy H2O** is extremely valuable! Full party heal from any distance. Save for emergencies or later boss battles.

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Very Hard - "Pretty bad, but NOT if you stick together and heal after every round!!!"

This battle presents a critical strategic choice:

**Strategy #1: Escape Route** (Safer, Less EXP)
**Strategy #2: Fortify & Fight** (Harder, Maximum EXP)

Most players should use Strategy #2 for the massive EXP gains that push characters to Level 20.

---

### Strategy #2: Fortify & Fight (Recommended)

**Advantages:**
- "EXP goldmine" per author
- Push entire party to Level 20
- All treasures collectible
- Kane may not engage until late (he's far away)
- Plenty of time to clear Dallas and Kurtz

**Disadvantages:**
- Much harder than escape
- Requires excellent tactics
- Heavy healing item consumption
- Long battle

#### Phase 1: Critical Opening (Turn 1)

**TURN 1 PRIORITY ACTION:**

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** Someone must **move box one space east** (near Kurtz's group)!

**Box Positioning:**
- Box is near NE (Kurtz's starting area)
- By default, Kurtz's group can charge directly south
- **Moving box 1 space east** blocks this route
- Forces Kurtz to take long backdoor (east-to-west) route
- Prevents pincer attack!
- Buys you 3-4 turns before Kurtz arrives

**Who Moves Box:**
- Fast character (Hawknight, Monk, etc.)
- Someone who can then retreat to safety
- Not a critical fighter needed for Dallas

**Rest of Party Turn 1:**
1. **Stay grouped** at starting position
2. **Don't advance yet** - let enemies approach
3. Position for defensive counterattacks
4. Prepare magic users for Turn 2

{: .important }
> **Box Strategy is KEY:** Authors repeatedly emphasize this. Without blocking Kurtz, you face 3 groups at once = overwhelming!

#### Phase 2: Dallas & Northwest Group (Turns 2-4)

**Why Dallas First:**
- Closest to starting position (NW corner)
- Smallest entourage (only 2 helpers)
- **Armored units weak to magic**
- Must kill fast before he heals

**Dallas Group Composition:**
- Dallas Greatarmor (L21, 176 HP)
- 2 C. Armor (L19, 160 HP each)
- Total: 3 enemies

**Turn 2 - Let Them Approach:**
1. Dallas's group advances toward party
2. **Don't move forward yet** - maintain defensive position
3. They walk into your counterattack range
4. Prepare Phase Shift and Roman Fire

**Turn 3 - Magic Barrage:**

**Zohar/Eleni (Sorcerors):**
1. **Phase Shift** into Dallas's group
   - R3-7, F1 = can hit all 3
   - ~100+ damage to each Armor unit!
   - May one-shot the C. Armors
   - Heavily damages Dallas
2. **Roman Fire** as backup AOE
   - Good if Phase Shift already used

**Archers:**
1. Fire into Dallas from range
2. Soften C. Armors if still alive
3. 40-50 damage each

**Frontline:**
1. **Don't engage Dallas in melee yet** - he hits for 100+ damage!
2. Clean up C. Armors if wounded
3. Stay in formation

**Turn 4 - Finishing Dallas:**

{: .danger }
> **Dallas One-Shot Potential:** Author reports "Dallas OHKO'd 128 HP once!" Keep characters at full HP when engaging!

**Strike Fast Strategy:**
1. Dallas should be ~80-100 HP remaining after Turn 3 magic
2. **Before he can heal**, strike with 2-3 strong attackers
3. Recommended hitters:
   - Grog (Duelist) - high AT
   - Dolan (Duelist) - high AT
   - Ash (Champion) - **NOTE:** "Ash isn't too good against Dallas" - use others
4. **Kill in one turn** before Extra Healing

**If Dallas Heals:**
- Extra Healing restores ~40 HP
- Repeat magic barrage
- Don't let him heal multiple times

#### Phase 3: C. Hawks (Turns 3-5)

**C. Hawk Analysis:**
- Flying Airman units (2 total)
- High mobility = reach backline quickly
- Priority threat to mages/healers
- Start from various positions

**Turn 3-4 - Hawks Closing In:**
- As Dallas battle concludes, Hawks probably approaching
- Flying over obstacles to reach mages

**Hawk Elimination:**
1. **Archers focus fire** - very effective vs Hawks
   - Diego (Sniper/Sky Lord)
   - Amon (Sniper)
   - Darius (Sniper)
2. Two arrows typically kill each Hawk
3. **Kill Hawks before they reach mages!**

{: .warning }
> "Take out Crimson Hawks first" - Priority target! Don't let them harass your backline.

#### Phase 4: Kurtz & Northeast Group (Turns 5-7)

**Kurtz Arrival:**
- If you moved box Turn 1, Kurtz arrives around Turn 5-6
- Forced to take long route (east-to-west backdoor)
- You've already cleared Dallas by now

**Kurtz Group Composition:**
- Kurtz War Master (L21, 143 HP)
- 3 C. Knight (L19, 140 HP each)
- Total: 4 enemies

**Kurtz Boss Mechanics:**
- **DAGGER STORM** - Hits all tiles within 1 space
- ~70 damage to each target hit
- Range 5 = decent reach
- Can devastate clustered party

**Turn 5-6 - Position for Kurtz:**

**Defensive Formation:**
1. **Fill all gaps** in your formation
2. Create solid wall of fighters
3. **Only one enemy can attack per turn** if positioned correctly
4. Mages behind frontline (out of Dagger Storm range)

**Chokepoint Tactics:**
- Use building corners/edges
- Force Kurtz through narrow passage
- **He can only attack one character per turn** if properly positioned

**Turn 6-7 - Killing Kurtz:**

**Phase Shift Still Effective:**
1. Zohar/Eleni use magic on Kurtz group
2. ~50+ damage to each
3. Soften C. Knights

**Physical Assault:**
1. Counterattack C. Knights as they approach
2. Gang up on Kurtz with 3-4 fighters
3. **Watch out for Dagger Storm** - don't cluster!
4. Kill supporting Knights first, then Kurtz

**Dagger Storm Prevention:**
- Don't put 3+ characters adjacent to Kurtz
- He'll Dagger Storm and hit all
- Spread attackers around him (not clustered)

#### Phase 5: Kane & Southeast Group (Turns 7-10+)

**Kane's Behavior:**
- Starts far away in SE corner
- "May not advance until late fight" per author
- Largest entourage (3 C. Knights + 1 C. Hawk)
- Sometimes stays idle if can't reach

**Kane Group Composition:**
- Kane Assassin (L22, 161 HP) - highest level boss!
- 3 C. Knights (L19, 140 HP each)
- 1 C. Hawk (L18, 142 HP) - if not killed earlier
- Total: 5 enemies initially

**Turn 7-9 - Kane Approaches (or doesn't):**

**Enemy AI Behavior:**
- "No precedence to special characters when moving"
- Enemies idle if can't get close-range access
- Kane often waits for his group
- Use this time to heal and prepare

**Baiting Strategy:**
1. After Kurtz dies, advance toward Kane
2. His group starts moving
3. **Enemies weakened by Roman Fire** advance first
4. Get counterattacked and die
5. This thins Kane's entourage

**Turn 9-10+ - Kane Battle:**

{: .danger }
> **Warning:** Multiple counterattacks weaken the counterattackee! Don't use same character to counterattack all enemies.

**Approach:**
1. Let C. Knights approach first
2. Roman Fire into group
3. **Counterattacks** finish weakened Knights
4. **Rotate counterattackers** - don't let one take all hits
5. **Keep Ash protected** - "Make sure Ash isn't one with head on chopping block"

**Kane Himself:**
- HEALING CIRCLE(2) can heal nearby allies
- Kill his supporters first (denies healing targets)
- Then focus Kane with 3-4 attackers
- High AGL = acts often

#### Sustained Healing Strategy

{: .important }
> **Author's Emphasis:** "Heal after EVERY round!!!" This is the key to survival.

**Healing Every Turn:**
- Sara (Archbishop): **Ultra Healing** or Supreme Healing
- Huxley (Archbishop): Ultra Healing or Supreme Healing
- Megaherbs from inventory as backup

**Ultra Healing vs Healing Plus:**
> "When in doubt: Ultra Healing. Only costs 1 MP more than Healing Plus, always does more."

**At Level 16-20:**
- Ultra Healing: ~50-70 HP restored
- Healing Plus: ~40-50 HP restored
- Ultra Healing becoming superior

**Archbishop Holy Lightning:**
> "Bishops' Holy Lightning quite powerful (unexpectedly)"

- Holy Lightning: Offensive spell, ~60-80 damage
- When MP gets low late battle, use to squeeze out win
- Cheaper than big spells, decent damage
- Can hit bosses effectively

#### Treasure Collection

**Safe Collection Time:**
- After Kane's group is dead or heavily wounded
- Keep 1 enemy alive while collecting (Grenadier or wounded Knight)

**Collection Missions:**

**Priority 1 - Holy H2O (East):**
1. Send Hawknight or fast unit to (18,15)
2. Open chest → HOLY H2O
3. **Full heal all allies, any range!**
4. Extremely valuable item

**Priority 2 - Aura Gem (NE):**
1. Character moves to (18,21)
2. Open chest → AURA GEM
3. Magic attack +8 accessory
4. Equip on Zohar or Eleni

**Priority 3 - Gold Axe (Secret):**
1. Character moves to (13,26) in NE area
2. Look for "3-dot tile" or "stone with 3 dimples"
3. Search → GOLD AXE
4. Just a sellable (no special stats)

**Finish Battle:**
1. Kill last enemy
2. **Move all allies to exit gate** (must leave Khanos)
3. Battle ends when all at gate

---

### Strategy #1: Escape Route (Alternative)

For players who want faster/safer completion:

**Concept:** Run to exit instead of fighting all enemies.

**Execution:**

**Turn 1:**
1. Move party toward SW
2. Character hits SW switch
3. Lowers bridge through south-middle
4. Opens path to exit gate

**Problem:**
- Dallas's team starts near SW
- Annoying to get past him

**Turn 2-4:**
1. **Mass-damage magic** (Phase Shift, Roman Fire) into Dallas group
2. Kill or severely wound to clear path
3. Run past toward bridge

**Bottleneck Fighting:**
- Must still fight Kane/Sabina's groups at bottleneck
- Phase Shift/Roman Fire into masses
- Creates opening to run through

**Final Sprint:**
1. Get all allies outside gate area
2. Don't need to kill all enemies
3. Victory when all escape

{: .note }
> Even with escape strategy, you'll get decent EXP. But Strategy #2 (fortify) gives much more - recommended for Level 20 push.

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Not Moving the Box Turn 1:**
- Kurtz charges directly at you Turn 2-3
- Face 3 groups at once
- Overwhelming = likely party wipe

**❌ Letting Bosses Heal Repeatedly:**
- Dallas heals self
- Kane heals others
- Sabina heals from range 8
- Must kill faster than they heal!

**❌ Clustering vs Kurtz:**
- Dagger Storm hits all adjacent tiles
- 3 characters clustered = all take 70 damage
- Spread attackers around him

**❌ Not Healing Every Turn:**
- Damage accumulates
- Sudden death from gang-up
- **Heal every single turn without exception!**

**❌ Ash Counterattacking Everything:**
- Multiple counterattacks weaken character
- Ash has lower DF than Knights
- Rotate counterattackers

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Move box Turn 1 (blocks Kurtz)
- Kill Dallas first (closest, magic weak)
- Heal every turn (Ultra Healing)
- Fill gaps (limit attacks per turn)
- Rotate counterattackers (spread damage)
- Kill bosses one at a time (focus fire)
- Collect treasures safely at end

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**
- **Dolf discovers Kira helped Clint escape** (prison liberation in Act 3)
- Xeno witnessed her betrayal
- **Kira thrown in brig** (imprisoned by Dolf)
- **Xeno sworn to help Dolf overthrow Hel** (alliance formed)

{: .warning }
> **CRITICAL:** After defeating enemies, **you cannot return to Khanos City!** The city becomes inaccessible for the rest of the game. Hope you bought all equipment before battle!

**Level Check:**
- Most characters should be 17-19 now
- Some may hit Level 20
- **Visit Dojo for class advancements!**

**Next Destination:** Great Masai Forest

---

## Battle 4.2: Great Masai Forest

**Recommended Level:** 18
**Map Size:** 20×24 grid
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .note }
> **Large Enemy Count:** 22 enemies total! Good for experience farming, but manage positioning carefully.

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Notes |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:------|
| Bugaboo (Bo) | 12 | 10 | 69 | 39 | 31 | 37 | Long-range archers |
| Wight (Kn) | 10 | 11 | 84 | 49 | 43 | 43 | Close-range fighters |

**Total Gold:** 17,160 G (highest in Act so far!)

**Total Enemies:** 22

{: .important }
> **EXP Opportunity:** 22 enemies = excellent for leveling! Combined with good gold, this is a farming battle.

### Enemy Analysis

**Bugaboo (Archer class):**
- **HUGE long-range attack range** (per author)
- More numerous (12 total)
- Low HP (69) = one-shot by strong attackers
- **Gang-up behavior** - tend to focus one character
- Flying movement (can cross terrain)
- Main threat in this battle

**Wight (Knight class):**
- Typical close-range fighters
- Moderate HP (84) = 2 hits to kill
- Less dangerous than Bugaboos
- Slower movement
- Secondary threat

{: .danger }
> **Bugaboo Danger:** "Bugaboos tend to gang up on a character from a VERY long distance!" - Multiple archers firing at once = quick death.

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items (2):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|
| (17,22) | KINGFOIL | NE corner, cracked crater / hole in riverside |
| (11,5) | AURA GEM | S area, spiral-marked tile / fossil print / shell at top of waterfall |

{: .note }
> "Both are very obvious" - Easy to spot with visual markers.

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Easy/Fun - "Very fun and basic fight"

Despite 22 enemies, this is one of the easier battles in Act 4. Enemies are lower-level than your party, and the map layout favors defensive positioning.

#### Recommended Strategy: Split Party Bridges

**Map Layout:**
- Waterfall in center/south
- **Two bridges** crossing water (north and south)
- Trees and terrain for cover
- Multi-level elevation

**Split Groups:**
- **Group 1:** 5-6 characters to North bridge
- **Group 2:** 5-6 characters to South bridge
- Spread forces to collect both secrets efficiently

{: .important }
> **Send clerical unit (healer) with each group!** Sara with one, Huxley with other.

#### Phase 1: Bridge Positioning (Turns 1-2)

**North Bridge Group:**
1. 5-6 characters move toward north bridge
2. **Include healer** (Sara or Huxley)
3. Cross bridge to engage enemies on other side
4. Position for NE secret (Kingfoil)

**South Bridge Group:**
1. Remaining characters toward south bridge
2. **Include healer** (the other priest)
3. Cross to engage enemies
4. Position for S secret (Aura Gem at waterfall)

**Why Split Works:**
- Covers both treasure locations
- Enemies split attention between groups
- Neither group gets overwhelmed
- "Enemies' long-range plays into height advantage" - you can shoot back

#### Phase 2: Combat Tactics (Turns 2-5)

**Anti-Bugaboo Tactics:**

**Use Scenery:**
- **Trees obscure Bugaboo range**
- Position behind trees
- Limits how many can fire at you
- "Use scenery (trees) to obscure their range"

**Focus Fire:**
- **One hit from strong attacker kills Bugaboos**
- High-AT characters one-shot them
- Archers excellent (archer vs archer)
- Don't waste overkill damage

**Priority Target:**
1. Kill Bugaboos closest to your position first
2. Work outward from your group
3. Clear line of sight threats
4. Wights are lower priority (they have to close distance)

**Combat Math:**
- "Overall: 2 attacks kill each enemy"
- Bugaboos: 1 strong hit (69 HP)
- Wights: 2 hits (84 HP)
- Easy cleanup

**Magic Usage:**

**Phase Shift:**
- Good if 3+ Bugaboos grouped
- ~50+ damage = doesn't quite one-shot at this level
- Leaves them wounded for physical finish

**Roman Fire:**
- Similar to Phase Shift
- Use on Wight groups (higher HP)

**Healing:**
- Should be minimal
- "Not damaging unless hit Hawknight"
- Bugaboos hurt flying units most
- Heal when damaged, otherwise attack

#### Phase 3: Secret Collection (Turns 3-6)

**Kingfoil (NE Corner):**
1. **North bridge group** sends character NE
2. Coordinates: (17,22)
3. "NE riverside crater" or "hole in NE corner"
4. Search → KINGFOIL (healing item)

**Aura Gem (South Waterfall):**
1. **South bridge group** sends character south
2. Coordinates: (11,5)
3. "Shell at top of waterfall" or "fossil print" or "spiral-marked tile"
4. Search → AURA GEM (magic attack +8)

{: .note }
> Both secrets have visual markers making them easy to find. Look for crater/shell/spiral patterns on ground.

#### Phase 4: Cleanup (Turns 5-8)

**Once Bugaboos Thinned:**
1. Remaining Wights approach for melee
2. Much less dangerous (close-range only)
3. Counterattacks effective
4. Standard physical combat finishes them

**Convergence:**
- Two groups can meet in middle
- Combine to eliminate stragglers
- Flying units chase down fleeing enemies
- Victory when all 22 dead

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Not Splitting Party:**
- Keeping all 12 together
- Can't reach both secrets efficiently
- Enemies swarm one location

**❌ Ignoring Bugaboo Range:**
- Walking into open areas
- 5-6 Bugaboos fire at once
- Character drops quickly

**❌ Overkilling Bugaboos:**
- Using strongest attacks on 69 HP enemies
- Wasting damage potential
- Let weaker characters finish them

**❌ No Healers with Groups:**
- Split party but both healers in one group
- Other group has no healing
- Casualties result

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Split party across two bridges
- Healer with each group
- Use trees for cover
- One-shot Bugaboos efficiently
- Collect both secrets
- Simple cleanup

**Scene: Xeno Revelation:**
- Party meets **Xeno** directly (confrontation)
- **Zohar reveals:** Xeno was his pupil **300 years ago!**
- **Xeno responsible for Zohar's time warp** (Act 3 time displacement)
- **Xeno's goal:** Rekindle the **Flames of Judgement** (destroy world?)

**Major Reveal:**
- **Carlo is Diego's father!**
- Carlo involved in purchase of Royal Ring

**Level Status:**
- "Most of my guys were now Lev20 or higher" per author
- **Level 20 = double advancement** possible
- Can advance twice in a row at Dojo if Level 20+

**Next Destination:** Old Town Warehouse

## Battle 4.3: Old Town Warehouse - Trap Battle

**Recommended Level:** 19
**Map Size:** 23×23 grid
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .danger }
> **Trap Setup:** Carlo and Xeno have set up an ambush! Enemies gang up aggressively.

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Notes |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:------|
| Skeleton (Kn) | 8 | 16 | 119 | 68 | 59 | 59 | Close-range fighters |
| Eggworm (Bo) | 4 | 13 | 88 | 49 | 39 | 47 | Flying archers |
| Gold Golem (Ar) | 4 | 16 | 136 | 77 | 83 | 45 | Heavy armor units |

**Total Gold:** 13,760 G

**Total Enemies:** 16

### Enemy Analysis

**Skeleton (Knight class):**
- Most numerous (8 total)
- Moderate stats across board
- Gang-up behavior
- Close-range threat

**Eggworm (Archer class):**
- Flying projectile enemies
- "New breed of projectile-spewing filth"
- All sides with high ground advantage
- **Will NOT bode well for Hawknights!**
- Ranged attack threat
- Priority targets

**Gold Golem (Armor class):**
- Heavy armor (DF 83)
- High HP (136)
- Slow movement (AGL 45)
- **Weak to magic!** (rock-paper-scissors)
- Take 100+ damage from Phase Shift

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items:** None

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Hard - "Kinda hard" / "I lost all but 4 guys to the spitters"

{: .danger }
> **Author's Experience:** Lost 6 of 12 characters! Heavy casualties expected. This is one of the harder battles in Act 4.

#### Starting Situation (Difficult)

**Surrounded Formation:**
- Party starts in center of warehouse
- **Eggworms on all sides with high ground**
- Gold Golems scattered around perimeter
- Skeletons filling gaps
- Enemy has height advantage initially

**First Turn is Critical:**
> "First few turns crucial but can be easy" if you execute properly

#### Phase 1: Pick a Direction (Turn 1)

**Critical Decision:**
- **Decide which direction to move** (North or South)
- Pick structure where one Eggworm is
- **Move everyone toward that direction as a group**
- Don't split party - stay together!

**Why This Works:**
- Concentrates firepower
- Enemies can't surround you
- Takes high ground from one Eggworm group
- Creates defensive position

**Turn 1 Execution:**

**Entire Party:**
1. Move toward chosen direction (e.g., North structure)
2. **Stay grouped** - no stragglers
3. **Prepare Phase Shift** - Zohar/Eleni ready to cast Turn 2
4. Climb to high ground if possible

#### Phase 2: Phase Shift Devastation (Turns 2-3)

{: .important }
> **Author's Tactic:** "Watch who they gang up on, make sure to protect Ash. I used Phase Shift alot."

**Turn 2 - Magic Assault:**

**Zohar (Enchanter):**
1. **Phase Shift** into enemy masses
2. Should hit 3-4 enemies (Golems + Skeletons)
3. **Kills nearby golems with ease (100+ damage!)**
4. Damages Skeletons enough for single counterattack kill (~50 damage)
5. "Sets them up for huge Phase Shift in coming turns"

**Eleni (Enchanter):**
1. **Phase Shift** into different group
2. More mass destruction
3. Multiple Golems eliminated

**Why Phase Shift Dominates:**
- Golems weak to magic (Armor class)
- 100+ damage to Golems (136 HP) = near one-shot
- 50+ damage to Skeletons (119 HP) = weakened for counterattack finish
- R3-7, F1 = hits area, can hit 3-4 enemies
- "Phase Shift like it's going out of style!"

**Turn 3 - Continued Barrage:**
1. Second round of Phase Shifts
2. "Leaves ~half field out of range"
3. Positions them for huge Phase Shift next turn
4. Systematic elimination

#### Phase 3: Eggworm Priority (Turns 2-4)

**Eggworm Threat:**
- Flying = high mobility
- Ranged = attacks from distance
- High ground = advantageous position
- Multiple angles of attack
- "Long-range stranglehold"

**Elimination Strategy:**
1. **Take out quickly** to ease pressure
2. Archers focus fire (Diego, Amon, Darius)
3. Two arrows per Eggworm (88 HP)
4. Flying units engage flying enemies
5. **When close-range forces thin, less effective** - kill early!

**Priority:**
1. Eggworms nearest your position
2. Ones with clear line of fire
3. Those targeting mages/healers
4. Work outward from your group

#### Phase 4: Watch for Gang-Ups (All Turns)

{: .danger }
> **Gang-Up AI:** "Spitters gang up on characters" - Multiple enemies focus one target.

**Gang-Up Detection:**
- **Watch enemy positioning** each turn
- Look for multiple enemies in range of one character
- "Watch who they gang up on"

**Protection Tactics:**

**Protect Ash:**
- "Make sure to protect Ash"
- Don't let him get isolated
- Keep surrounded by allies
- Ash death = game over

**Defensive Formation:**
- Frontline: Grog, Dolan, Clint (high DF knights)
- Mid-range: Archers and flying units
- Backline: Zohar, Eleni, Sara, Huxley (mages/healers)
- **Never leave mages exposed!**

**Heal Frequently:**
- Heal targeted characters immediately
- Don't wait for next turn
- Gang-ups can kill in one turn cycle
- Megaherbs if priests busy

#### Phase 5: Danger Zone - First Enemy Turn

{: .warning }
> "If anyone dies, it's probably first enemy turn. Everyone finds target to gang up on."

**First Enemy Turn (Turn 2):**
- All enemies activate
- Each looks for targets
- **They coordinate gang-ups** - AI focuses fire
- Most dangerous moment in battle

**Survival Tactics:**
1. **Grouped formation** limits exposed targets
2. **Knights in front** absorb attacks (high HP/DF)
3. **Mages behind** = out of range
4. **Spread positioning slightly** - not all clustered
   - Clustered = one Phase Shift/AOE hits all
   - Spread = only one target per enemy

**Expected Casualties:**
- Author lost 6 characters even playing well
- Accept some losses
- Prioritize keeping Ash, Zohar, Eleni, Sara alive
- Knights can fall if necessary

#### Phase 6: Cleanup (Turns 4-6)

**Once Golems and Eggworms Dead:**
- Only Skeletons remain
- Much easier (standard melee enemies)
- Counterattacks effective
- Simple physical combat

**Convergence:**
1. Regroup party if spread
2. Heal wounded characters
3. Eliminate remaining Skeletons
4. Victory

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Splitting Party:**
- Trying to fight on multiple fronts
- Characters get isolated
- Gang-ups kill isolated members

**❌ Ignoring Eggworms:**
- Focusing on Skeletons/Golems first
- Eggworms continue shooting from range
- Long-range pressure accumulates

**❌ Not Using Phase Shift:**
- Physical attacks vs Golems = inefficient
- Takes 3-4 hits to kill without magic
- Phase Shift one-shots them

**❌ Exposing Ash:**
- Letting Ash get surrounded
- Gang-up kills him = game over
- Must protect protagonist

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Pick one direction, move entire party
- Phase Shift spam vs Golems
- Kill Eggworms quickly
- Protect Ash at all costs
- Stay grouped
- Accept some casualties

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**

**Carlo's Redemption:**
- **Carlo set up the party** - betrayal revealed!
- He was working with Xeno (trap arranged)
- At last moment, **Carlo defends company** - saves Ash's party!
- Carlo recovers from his wounds later
- **Father-son talk** between Carlo and Diego
- Complicated relationship explored
- Some reconciliation between them

**Royal Ring Location:**
- Ring being taken back to **Shumeria by train**
- Next target: **Magic Train Station**
- Must intercept ring during transport

**Level Status:**
> "Most of my guys were now Lev20 or higher"

- Majority of party Level 20+
- **Can advance twice in row** at Dojo
- Final class tiers opening up

**Next Destination:** Magic Train Station

## Battle 4.4: Magic Train Railroad - Moving Train Battle

**Recommended Level:** 20
**Map Size:** 64×8 grid (**LONGEST MAP IN GAME!**)
**Victory Condition:** Defeat of Dallas
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .danger }
> **Boss Return:** Dallas Greatarmor is back! He can heal himself again. Must kill quickly.

{: .important }
> **CRITICAL ITEM:** **RAMEN** is hidden on this map! Collector's Treasure #3 for Chaos Key. Don't finish battle without it!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| **Dallas Greatarmor** (Boss) | 1 | 21 | 176 | 99 | 107 | 57 | EXTRA HEALING R5 |
| C. Knight (Kn) | 8 | 17 | 126 | 72 | 63 | 63 | None |
| C. Shooter (Bo) | 4 | 17 | 113 | 63 | 50 | 60 | Ranged attacks |
| C. Armor (Ar) | 4 | 18 | 152 | 86 | 93 | 50 | Heavy armor |

**Total Gold:** 16,920 G

**Total Enemies:** 17

### Boss: Dallas Greatarmor (Returns from 4.1)

**Stats:**
- Level 21, 176 HP
- AT 99, DF 107 (extremely high defense!)
- EXTRA HEALING R5 (self-heal, ~40 HP)
- Armor class = **weak to magic**
- **Physical attacks POWERFUL** - can OHKO weaker characters
- "Dallas weak to magic (not as weak as armored counterparts)"

{: .danger }
> **Dallas Threat:** Physical attacks can one-shot characters! Keep everyone at full HP when engaging. Use magic for damage.

### Special Mechanics: Moving Train

**Map Layout:**
- **64 squares wide** - longest map in entire game!
- 8 squares tall (narrow height)
- Train with multiple flatbed cars
- Each car has enemies
- Cars arranged in sequence

**Car Release Schedule:**

| Car | Release After | Notes |
|:----|:--------------|:------|
| Car 1 | Immediately available | Front car, nearest start |
| Car 2 | 2 turns | Short gap |
| Car 3 | 5 turns | Medium gap |
| Car 4 | 8 turns | Long gap |
| Car 5 (Dallas) | 11 turns | Longest gap - 4 turns before disconnect |

{: .warning }
> **Time Pressure:** Cars disconnect after couple turns! "Flatbed train cars disconnect after couple turns" - **Advance forward swiftly!**

**Longest Car:**
- Car with height differential takes **4 turns to disconnect**
- Gives you 4-turn window to clear it
- Dallas is on this car (final car)

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items (1):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description | Notes |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|:------|
| (11,3) | **RAMEN** | Front car, floor grate near Dallas | **CHAOS KEY ITEM #3!** |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** **RAMEN** is Collector's Treasure #3! Need: MACROMAN (Act 2) + TAROT (Act 3) + **RAMEN (Act 4)** to trade for Chaos Key! **DO NOT FINISH BATTLE WITHOUT IT!**

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Medium - "Pretty simple" but time pressure

The challenge isn't the enemies (relatively straightforward), but the **time limit** imposed by disconnecting cars and the **long map** requiring fast movement.

#### Turn-by-Turn Strategy

**Turn 1 - Car 1 Assault:**

{: .important }
> **Speed is Essential:** "Advance forward swiftly!" - Dallas's comments should frighten slower players.

**Opening Barrage:**
- **2 Roman Fires** into Car 1 enemies
- **Some arrows** from archers
- **Rolling Fire** if order messed up (Ash's Hero spell?)
- "First car taken out Turn 1"

**Why This Works:**
- Enemies grouped on car = perfect AOE target
- Roman Fire hits 2-3 enemies each
- ~50-60 damage per target
- Arrows finish wounded
- "Basically massacre"

**Turn 1 Results:**
- Car 1 enemies dead or nearly dead
- Draws Car 2 enemies into range
- Path clear to advance

**Turn 2 - Car 2 Engagement:**

**Advance Party:**
1. Frontline moves onto cleared Car 1
2. Ranged units fire at Car 2 enemies
3. Magic users position for Car 3 barrage

**Car 2 Tactics:**
- Same as Car 1: AOE magic + arrows
- "This is strategy throughout to Dallas' car"
- Repeat pattern for each car
- Systematic progression

**Movement Priorities:**
- **Fast units advance first** (Hawknights, Monks)
- **Slow units start moving early** (Armored units)
- Don't leave anyone behind!
- Warriors with poor movement = handicap

**Turn 3-4 - Car 3:**

**Continued Assault:**
1. Magic barrage (Roman Fire, Phase Shift)
2. Arrow support
3. Melee cleanup as you reach car
4. Keep moving forward

**Turn 5-7 - Car 4:**

**Same Pattern:**
- AOE magic devastates grouped enemies
- Archers pick off stragglers
- Physical attackers finish
- "Really pays to level-up!"

#### Dallas's Car: The Hardest (Turns 8-11)

**Enemy Composition on Dallas's Car:**
- Dallas Greatarmor (boss)
- 4 C. Armor (heavy armor support)
- 4 C. Shooter (archers below on level difference)
- "Annoying archers below powerful armored allies"

{: .danger }
> **Difficult Setup:** Shooters on lower level, Armors on upper level with Dallas. Multi-level combat.

**Turn 8-9 - Approach Dallas's Car:**

**MP Conservation:**
- "Save some MP for slaughter here"
- Previous cars: use MP sparingly
- Dallas's car: unleash everything
- **Magic Charge** (Bishop spell) gives ally 10 MP
  - Sara/Huxley can recharge Zohar/Eleni
  - Enables extra Phase Shifts

**Position for Assault:**
1. Ranged units position at edge of previous car
2. Can fire into Dallas's car from distance
3. Mages ready to cast
4. Melee units prepare to board

**Turn 9-10 - Dallas Car Assault:**

**Phase 1 - Magic Barrage:**

**Zohar/Eleni:**
1. **Phase Shift** into Armored enemies
2. 100+ damage to each C. Armor
3. One-shots or near one-shots them
4. Dallas takes heavy damage too

**Sara/Huxley:**
- **Magic Charge** on Sorcerors for MP refill
- Enables second Phase Shift
- Or **Holy Lightning** for damage if needed

**Phase 2 - Archer Threat:**

{: .warning }
> **C. Shooters Below:** On lower level, hard to reach. Shoot your Hawknights if you send them forward!

**Shooter Elimination:**
1. Archers focus fire (long-range vs long-range)
2. Diego, Amon, Darius concentrate fire
3. Two shots per Shooter
4. **Keep Hawknights out of Shooter range** until Shooters dead

**Phase 3 - Dallas Himself:**

**Weaknesses:**
- Armor class = **weak to magic**
- Phase Shift hits hard (but not as hard as vs C. Armors)
- Can heal himself (EXTRA HEALING)

**Kill Strategy:**
1. **Magic first** - Phase Shift from Zohar/Eleni
   - ~70-80 damage to Dallas
2. **Long-range attacks** after magic barrage
   - Archers fire from safety
   - 40-50 damage each
3. **Physical attacks POWERFUL** - he hits back hard!
   - Can OHKO weaker characters
   - Don't send mages into melee with him!
4. **Kill before he heals multiple times**
   - Extra Healing restores ~40 HP
   - Focus fire to overwhelm healing

**EXP Farming (Optional):**
- "Weaken Dallas so next turn = Extra Healing"
- He can use Extra Healing 3 times
- "Get max EXP before he boards train to Hell!"
- Only if you want to milk EXP

#### RAMEN Collection (CRITICAL!)

{: .danger }
> **DO NOT KILL DALLAS BEFORE GETTING RAMEN!** This is the ONLY chance to get it!

**RAMEN Location:**
- Coordinates: **(11,3)**
- "W car with Dallas" - on Dallas's car
- "Floor grate" - special tile marking
- "Engine" area per some authors
- Near Dallas's starting position

**Collection Timing:**
- **Before killing Dallas** - battle ends when he dies
- After clearing most enemies on his car
- Send fast unit (Hawknight/Sky Lord ideal)

**Collection Execution:**

**Diego (if Sky Lord/Hawknight):**
1. Fly onto Dallas's car
2. Navigate to (11,3) - grate tile
3. Search → **RAMEN**
4. Fly back to safety
5. **May not survive due to archers** - accept this

**Alternative:**
- Send ground unit after Shooters dead
- Safer but slower
- Verify RAMEN obtained before killing Dallas!

**Author's Advice:**
> "Hawknight/Sky Lord great for this. May not survive due to archers (keep out of range!)"

#### Final Push

**After RAMEN Secured:**
1. **Verify RAMEN in inventory** (critical!)
2. Finish Dallas with combined assault
3. Magic + ranged + melee converge
4. Victory when Dallas falls

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Moving Too Slowly:**
- Cars disconnect
- Missing enemies/EXP
- Getting left behind

**❌ Wasting MP Early:**
- Overusing Phase Shift on Cars 1-3
- No MP left for Dallas's car
- Inefficient progression

**❌ Forgetting RAMEN:**
- Killing Dallas first
- Battle ends, can't get RAMEN
- Locked out of Chaos Trial forever!

**❌ Sending Hawknights vs Shooters:**
- Flying units exposed to archer fire
- Shooters hit hard vs flying units
- Easy casualties

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Car 1: 2 Roman Fires + arrows = cleared
- Repeat for Cars 2-4
- Save MP for Dallas's car
- Get RAMEN before killing Dallas
- Magic Charge for MP refill
- Kill Shooters before sending Hawknights
- Verify RAMEN in inventory!

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**
- **Royal Ring obtained!** Party secures the artifact
- **Xeno appears** - confrontation
- Xeno offers trade: **Kira for Ring**
- Party must decide

**Return to Kerachi:**
- Next destination: Kerachi City
- Advance any new Level 20 characters at Dojo

**CHAOS KEY TRADE:**

{: .important }
> **If you have all 3 Collector's Treasures**, you can now complete the Chaos Key quest!

**Required Items:**
1. ✅ **MACROMAN** (from Act 2, Battle 2.1)
2. ✅ **TAROT** (from Act 3, Battle 3.3)
3. ✅ **RAMEN** (just obtained from 4.4!)

**Trade Process:**
1. Go to **Kerachi Tavern**
2. Talk to **man interested in strange objects**
3. He **gives you CHAOS KEY** (doesn't even trade - just gives it!)
   - "He flat-out gives it... Token of awesome taste!"
4. **CHAOS KEY** obtained → Unlocks Trial #4!

**Next Battle:** Fort Dain (Kira rescue mission)

---

## Optional: Trial of Chaos (Trial #4)

**Unlock Requirement:** CHAOS KEY (trade 3 Collector's Treasures at Kerachi Tavern)
**Recommended Level:** 20-21
**Map Size:** 20×16 grid

{: .note }
> This Trial becomes accessible after trading all 3 treasures. Detailed strategy available in [Trial of Chaos guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/trials/chaos/). This section provides complete battle information.

### How to Access

1. **Collect all 3 Collector's Treasures:**
   - MACROMAN (Act 2, Battle 2.1)
   - TAROT (Act 3, Battle 3.3)
   - RAMEN (Act 4, Battle 4.4)
2. **Trade at Kerachi Tavern** → receive CHAOS KEY
3. Give CHAOS KEY to Ash (equip as item)
4. Enter any Dojo
5. Select "Leave" option
6. Dojomaster asks about transformation
7. Select "Yes" to enter Trial

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Notes |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:------|
| Clay Golem (Ar) | 3 | Scales with Ash | Varies | Varies | Varies | Varies | Weakest golems |
| Dark Golem (Ar) | 7 | Scales with Ash | Varies | Varies | Varies | Varies | Medium golems |
| Gold Golem (Ar) | 8 | Scales with Ash | ~176 | Varies | Varies | Varies | Strongest golems |

**Total Enemies:** 18 Golems (all Armor class!)

{: .important }
> **All Armor Types:** Every enemy is Armor class. Mages are EXTREMELY effective! Phase Shift dominates.

**Total Gold:** 180 G (minimal)

### Special Mechanic: Box Puzzle

**Map Layout:**
- Multi-tiered arena
- **3 boxes** (crates/boulders) positioned on different tiers
- **Aqueducts** connecting tiers
- Chest on highest tier (requires bridge)
- **Must stack all 3 boxes** to create bridge to chest

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL PUZZLE:** Need ALL 3 boxes to form bridge to chest! If you trap a box in a corner, you fail the puzzle and cannot get the Chaos Prism!

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (1):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Notes |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:------|
| NE high tier | (13,14) | **CHAOS PRISM** | **Must build bridge to reach!** |

{: .danger }
> **YOU MUST GET THE CHAOS PRISM!** If you defeat all enemies without collecting it, you lose access to the prism forever. Cannot retry Trial!

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Medium - "Golems are easy" but puzzle is tricky

The combat is straightforward (all Armor weak to magic), but the **box puzzle requires planning**. Many players fail by trapping boxes incorrectly.

#### Phase 1: Golem Cleanup (Turns 1-5)

**Why Kill Most Golems First:**
- Need time to solve box puzzle
- Golems interfere with box pushing
- Can't focus on puzzle while fighting
- **Leave 3 golems at top alone** - they buy time

**Combat Strategy:**

**Zohar/Eleni (Enchanters):**
1. **Phase Shift spam** - "Do a bunch of Phase Shifts"
2. 100+ damage to each Golem
3. One-shot or near one-shot most
4. R3-7, F1 = can hit multiple at once
5. Most effective spell in this Trial

**Physical Attackers:**
1. "Couple of attacks" finish wounded Golems
2. Clean up stragglers
3. Support magic users

**Target Priority:**
1. **Lower tier Golems first** (near start)
2. Work up toward higher tiers
3. **Leave 3 Gold Golems on top tier alive**
   - They're far from boxes
   - Need them as "timers" while solving puzzle
   - Insurance so battle doesn't end

{: .important }
> **Keep 3 Golems Alive:** Critical! Need time to push boxes without battle ending. "Leave 3 golems at top alone"

#### Phase 2: Understanding the Box Puzzle

**Goal:**
- Stack all 3 boxes to create bridge
- Bridge allows access to highest tier
- Chest with Chaos Prism on highest tier

**Box Locations:**

| Box | Starting Tier | Notes |
|:----|:--------------|:------|
| Box 1 | Lowest tier (1st) | Must move first |
| Box 2 | Middle tier (2nd) | Moves second |
| Box 3 | Upper tier (3rd) | Moves last |

**Aqueducts:**
- Channels connecting tiers
- Boxes can be pushed through aqueducts
- Boxes stack on top of each other
- Creates "stairs" or "bridge"

{: .danger }
> **THE TRICK:** Don't get 1st tier box trapped in a corner! "The trick is NOT to get the 1st tier box trapped in a corner"

#### Phase 3: Box Puzzle Solution (Turns 5-10)

**Step 1 - Position Box 1 (Lowest Tier):**

**Initial Setup:**
1. Push lowest tier box to wall
2. Allows characters to climb to 2nd tier
3. This is temporary position

**Moving Box 1 Around:**
1. **Push 1st tier box ALL the way around** perimeter
2. Don't push across middle (traps it!)
3. Push around edges **by chest area** (final destination)
4. "Spend next couple rounds pushing 1st tier box all the way around by chest"
5. This takes several turns

**Critical Warning:**
> "The trick is NOT to get the 1st tier box trapped in a corner"

- If pushed into corner = can't get out
- If can't reach aqueduct = can't use for bridge
- Puzzle fails = no Chaos Prism

**Step 2 - Move Characters to 3rd Tier:**

**While Pushing Box 1:**
1. **Move 1-2 characters to 3rd tier** (highest)
2. Recommended: Ash + Healer
   - "Author used Ash"
   - Healer for safety
3. **DON'T ATTACK the golems** yet
   - Need them alive for time
   - Insurance enemies

**Why Characters on 3rd Tier:**
- Can handle 3 remaining Golems if needed
- Protected position
- Ready to get chest when bridge complete

**Step 3 - Push Box 2 (Middle Tier):**

**After Box 1 in Position:**
1. Box 1 is now near chest area (on 1st tier)
2. **Push 2nd tier box through aqueduct**
3. Box 2 lands **on top of Box 1**
4. First part of bridge complete!

**Step 4 - Push Box 3 (Upper Tier):**

**Final Box:**
1. Push 3rd tier box to where 2nd one started
2. **Push through aqueduct**
3. Box 3 lands **on top of other two**
4. **VOILA, instant bridge!** (three boxes stacked)
5. "Beauty, eh?"

**Bridge Complete:**
- All 3 boxes stacked
- Creates stairs/bridge to highest tier
- Can now reach chest

#### Phase 4: Get Prism & Finish (Turn 10+)

**Collect Chaos Prism:**
1. Character walks across box bridge
2. Reach highest tier where chest is
3. Open chest → **CHAOS PRISM**
4. **VERIFY IN INVENTORY!**

**Cleanup:**
1. Kill 3 remaining Golems on top tier
2. Easy with character already there + Phase Shift
3. Victory

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Trapping Box 1 in Corner:**
- Pushing box into corner
- Can't get it out
- Can't complete bridge
- Puzzle fails = no prism

**❌ Killing All Golems Too Fast:**
- Battle ends before puzzle solved
- No time to push boxes
- Lose prism access

**❌ Not Leaving Insurance Golems:**
- Kill all enemies
- Battle ends immediately
- Can't get to chest

**❌ Pushing Boxes Wrong Order:**
- Trying to move Box 3 before Box 1
- Doesn't work
- Must go in sequence

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Kill most Golems (Phase Shift spam)
- Leave 3 on top tier
- Push Box 1 around perimeter to chest area
- Stack Box 2 on Box 1 (through aqueduct)
- Stack Box 3 on others (through aqueduct)
- Cross bridge, get Chaos Prism
- Verify in inventory
- Kill last 3 Golems

### Post-Trial

**Reward:**
- **CHAOS PRISM** (4/6 Prisms for Vandalier)
- 180 G
- Minimal EXP

**Progress:**
- ✅ Nova Prism (Trial #1)
- ✅ Earth Prism (Trial #2)
- ✅ Mana Prism (Trial #3)
- ✅ **Chaos Prism (Trial #4)** ← Just obtained!
- ⬜ Logos Prism (Trial #5 - Act 5)
- ⬜ Heaven Prism (Trial #6 - Act 6)

**4 of 6 Prisms obtained! Two-thirds complete!**

## Battle 4.5: Fort Dain - Kira Rescue (Timed Battle)

**Recommended Level:** 21
**Map Size:** 23×23 grid
**Victory Condition:** Destroy all 8 Death Devices within 8 turns
**Defeat Condition:** Time runs out (Turn 9 arrives) OR Death of Ash or Kira

{: .danger }
> **8-TURN TIME LIMIT!** Must destroy all 8 Death Devices within 8 turns or you lose! This is the tightest time limit in the game so far.

{: .warning }
> **PROTECT KIRA:** Kira is marked as "enemy" with Death Device stats but you MUST protect her! Her death = defeat!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| **Death Device** (Objectives) | 8 | 1 | 14 | 0 | 5 | 0 | **Must destroy!** |
| **Kira** (NPC to protect) | 1 | 1 | 14 | 0 | 5 | 0 | **Don't let die!** |
| Skeleton (Kn) | 4 | 20 | 147 | 84 | 73 | 73 | None |
| Eggworm (Bo) | 2 | 19 | 126 | 69 | 55 | 66 | Ranged |
| Gold Golem (Ar) | 3 | 20 | 168 | 95 | 102 | 55 | Heavy armor |
| Acid Ghost (Ai) | 4 | 20 | 157 | 102 | 80 | 77 | Poison attacks |
| Death Angel (Ma) | 2 | 19 | 110 | 45 | 38 | 84 | **THUNDER BALL R5**, **HARMFUL WAVE R5** |

**Total Gold:** 16,400 G

**Total Enemies:** 15 (plus 8 devices + Kira)

### Objectives

**Death Devices:**
- 8 total scattered across map
- 14 HP each = 1-2 hits to destroy
- Stationary (don't move)
- **All 8 must be destroyed by end of Turn 8**
- These "hold Kira on doomsday platform"

**Kira:**
- Marked as "enemy" in game system
- Stats identical to Death Devices (1/14)
- Actually an NPC ally
- **Must survive** - her death = defeat
- Surrounded by Death Devices on platform

### Enemy Analysis

**Death Angel (Priority Threat!):**
- **HARMFUL WAVE** - **Range 8!** (extreme range)
- **THUNDER BALL** - Range 5, ~60-70 damage
- Lowest HP (110) = easiest to kill
- Highest priority targets
- Can devastate party from extreme distance

{: .danger }
> **Deathangel Danger:** HARMFUL WAVE has **RANGE 8!** "Stay out of Deathangel range or they'll devastate your party from extreme range!"

**Acid Ghost:**
- Flying Airman units (4 total)
- Physical attacks **inflict poison** (annoying!)
- High HP (157) and decent stats
- Secondary priority
- Don't let everyone get ganged up

**Gold Golem:**
- Heavy armor (DF 102)
- Highest HP (168)
- Weak to magic
- Block pathways

**Skeleton:**
- Standard melee threats
- Moderate danger
- 4 total

**Eggworm:**
- Flying archers (2 total)
- Ranged attacks
- Lower priority

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (2):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Value/Use |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:----------|
| Southwest | (3,1) | LIFE ORB | Full heal + MP restore |
| Northeast | (21,17) | L.MASK | Leather Mask (head armor) |

**Hidden Items (2):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|
| (18,1) | MITHRIL | SE corner, spiral-marked tile / shell |
| (9,21) | KINGFOIL | N side, cracked crater |

{: .note }
> Mithril is just money item - don't risk mission for it. "Mithril just money item (don't worry if miss)"

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Hard - Complex multi-objective timed battle

This is the most complex timed battle yet:
- 8-turn time limit
- Must destroy 8 objectives
- Must fight 15 enemies
- Must protect Kira
- Must manage split party
- Must avoid extreme-range mage attacks

{: .danger }
> **Author's Warning:** "SAVE Battle Often. Time's NOT as much of a problem as you might think, but the Deathangels ARE."

#### Core Strategy: Split Party Assault

**Why Split:**
- Death Devices scattered across map (can't reach all from one side)
- 8 turns is tight - need simultaneous attacks
- Enemies block pathways
- Must engage on multiple fronts

**Recommended Split:**
- **Team 1 (Golem Side):** 5-6 characters toward Golems (west/north)
- **Team 2 (Ghost Side):** 5-6 characters toward Acid Ghosts (east/south)

{: .important }
> **CRITICAL:** "Put healer in each group!" Sara with one team, Huxley with other. "As long as groups not imbalanced, simpler!"

#### Phase 1: Opening Positioning (Turn 1)

**Turn 1 - Split Formation:**

**Team 1 - Golem Side:**
- **Composition:** At least one mage + healer + fighters
  - Zohar (Enchanter) - magic for Golems
  - Sara (Archbishop) - healing
  - Grog, Dolan (fighters)
  - 1-2 others
- **Mission:** Head toward Golems (NW area)
- **Target:** Death Angels first, then Golems, then Devices

**Team 2 - Ghost Side:**
- **Composition:** Snipers + mage + healer + fighters
  - Diego (Sky Lord/Sniper) - flying + ranged
  - Amon, Darius (Snipers) - ranged attacks
  - Eleni (Enchanter) - magic
  - Huxley (Archbishop) - healing
  - Others
- **Mission:** Head toward Acid Ghosts (SE/SW area)
- **Target:** Death Angels first, then Acid Ghosts, then Devices

**Turn 1 Priorities:**
1. **Stay out of Death Angel range!**
   - Harmful Wave = Range 8
   - **PAUSE at each corner to keep out of range**
   - "Don't let these people break line of sight of far Deathangel"
2. Move toward assigned objectives
3. Don't engage yet - position only

{: .warning }
> **Line of Sight Control:** Death Angels use line of sight. Hide behind corners until ready to engage!

#### Phase 2: Priority Target Elimination (Turns 2-4)

**Priority Order:**
1. **Death Angels first** (both)
2. Acid Ghosts (threatening, poison)
3. Gold Golems (block paths)
4. Skeletons
5. Eggworms (least dangerous)

**Turn 2 - Death Angel Assault:**

**Team 1 (Golem Side):**
1. **Snipers on Death Angel**
   - "Archer essential for Deathangels"
   - "Better upwards-shooting radius than any archer class"
   - Long-range shots
2. **Lowest HP (110)** = easiest to snipe
3. Two arrows + maybe magic = dead
4. Eliminate before it casts HARMFUL WAVE

**Team 2 (Ghost Side):**
1. Same tactic on other Death Angel
2. Snipers focus fire
3. Kill Turn 2 if possible

**Why Death Angels First:**
> "Deathangel Danger: Harmful Wave has RANGE 8! Stay out of their line of sight or they'll devastate your party from extreme range!"

- HARMFUL WAVE range 8 = hits from across map
- Can hit 3-4 characters at once
- ~50-60 damage each
- Party wipe potential

**Turn 3-4 - Secondary Targets:**

**Acid Ghosts:**
1. "Taking out death machines easier once in position"
2. Long-range magic effective
3. Physical attacks inflict poison (annoying!)
4. Diego (flying) engages flying Acid Ghosts
5. Kill to clear paths to Death Devices

**Gold Golems:**
1. **Magic on Golems** - Zohar's Phase Shift
2. 100+ damage = one-shot or near one-shot
3. Armor class weakness
4. Clear paths

**Skeletons/Eggworms:**
- Lower priority
- Kill if blocking
- Otherwise bypass for Devices

{: .note }
> **Enemy AI Split:** "Sometimes SW Acid Ghost group splits if allies take two sides. Conquering weak enemy lot easier in this case."

#### Phase 3: Device Destruction (Turns 4-7)

**After Primary Threats Eliminated:**
- Death Angels dead
- Most Acid Ghosts/Golems dead or wounded
- Paths to Devices clear

**Death Device Mechanics:**
- 14 HP each
- 1 physical attack = kill (if AT 60+)
- 1 spell = kill
- 2 weaker attacks = kill
- Stationary (don't move)

**Destruction Strategy:**

**Bishops (Sara/Huxley):**
> "Bishop offensive spells can hit piddly death devices too!"

- Holy Lightning on Devices
- Decent damage, cheap MP
- Kill Devices while healing allies

**Mages (Zohar/Eleni):**
- Phase Shift if multiple Devices grouped
- Piercing Light single targets
- "Far-reaching magic (ignores height: Phase Shift)"

**Physical Attackers:**
- One hit each = destroyed
- Fast units (Hawknights, Monks) rush Devices
- Systematic elimination

**Coordination:**
- Team 1 destroys west/north Devices
- Team 2 destroys east/south Devices
- Work toward center (Kira's platform)
- Count Devices destroyed (must get all 8!)

#### Phase 4: Final Cleanup (Turns 7-8)

**Turn 7 - Verify Progress:**
1. Count Devices destroyed
2. How many left?
3. Can you reach remaining in 1-2 turns?
4. Any enemies still blocking?

**Turn 8 - Final Push:**
1. Destroy remaining Devices
2. Kill any remaining enemies (optional if Devices done)
3. Victory when all 8 Devices destroyed

{: .important }
> **Focus on Devices:** Killing enemies is secondary. Devices are the only objective! "Death Devices are the only objective!"

### Advanced Tactics

**Sniper Advantage:**
> "Snipers: Better upwards-shooting radius than any archer class"

- Snipers (Diego, Amon, Darius) shoot upward better than Bowmen
- Essential for elevated Death Devices
- Also great vs Death Angels (low HP)

**Warrior Movement:**
> "Those who haven't made warriors into Duelists may find level unforgiving. Poor movement = handicap."

- Guardsmen (2-move) struggle in 8 turns
- Duelists (3-move) much better
- If you haven't advanced Knights to Duelist, this battle is harder

**Balance is Key:**
> "As long as groups not imbalanced, simpler!"

- Even split (6-6 or 5-7)
- Healer in each
- Magic in each
- Ranged in each
- Balanced teams = success

### Treasure Collection

**Timing:**
- Treasures are NOT essential
- Mission time limit is tight
- Only collect if convenient

**Life Orb (SW):**
- Worth getting (full heal + MP)
- If Team 2 passes nearby
- Don't go out of way

**L.Mask (NE):**
- Optional
- Only if time permits

**Mithril (SE):**
- Just money item
- "Running for SE Mithril = stretch if trouble with Acid Ghosts"
- Skip if struggling

**Kingfoil (N):**
- Healing item
- Get if passing by
- Not worth detour

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Not Splitting Party:**
- Trying to clear all from one side
- Can't reach all Devices in 8 turns
- Time runs out = defeat

**❌ Ignoring Death Angels:**
- HARMFUL WAVE range 8 devastates party
- Must kill Turn 2-3
- Letting them cast repeatedly = wipe

**❌ Imbalanced Teams:**
- One team has both healers
- Other team has no healing
- Unbalanced team gets overwhelmed

**❌ Wasting Time on Regular Enemies:**
- Focusing on killing everything
- Forgetting Device objective
- Time runs out with Devices intact

**❌ Not Using Bishop Spells:**
- Forgetting bishops can hit Devices
- Holy Lightning cheap and effective
- Missing easy Device kills

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Split party evenly (healer each)
- Kill Death Angels Turn 2-3 (priority!)
- Clear Acid Ghosts and Golems next
- Destroy Devices systematically
- Use bishop spells on Devices
- Count Devices destroyed (all 8!)
- Ignore non-essential enemies
- Victory by Turn 8

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**

**Kira Saved:**
- Party successfully rescues Kira
- Forgive her for past actions
- Ask her to rejoin party
- **Kira rejoins party!** (though not as playable unit in battle)

**Kira's Royal Heritage:**
- **Kira revealed to be of Royal blood!**
- Descended from Ashah Dynasty
- Significant for Royal Ring connection
- Important for plot resolution

**Ring Inscription:**
- **Zohar deciphers inscription on Royal Ring**
- Reveals connection to Flames of Justice
- Story developments

**End of Act 4**

### Difficulty Assessment

**Hardest Battles:**
1. **4.1 (Khanos)** - 4 bosses, all heal, overwhelming
2. **4.5 (Fort Dain)** - 8-turn limit, complex objectives, Death Angels
3. **4.3 (Warehouse)** - Gang-up AI, heavy casualties

**Medium Difficulty:**
1. **4.4 (Railroad)** - Time pressure but straightforward
2. **Mana Trial** - 19 Mimics but manageable with planning
3. **Chaos Trial** - Box puzzle tricky but golems easy

**Easiest:**
1. **4.2 (Forest)** - Low-level enemies, simple tactics

### Tips for Perfect Clear

**Don't Miss:**
- ✓ **RAMEN** in 4.4 (Chaos Key component)
- ✓ **Holy H2O** in 4.1 (amazing item)
- ✓ **MANA PRISM** in Mana Trial (leave enemy alive!)
- ✓ **CHAOS PRISM** in Chaos Trial (don't trap boxes!)

**Strategic Priorities:**
- **4.1:** Move box Turn 1 (blocks Kurtz), heal every turn
- **4.3:** Phase Shift spam, stay grouped, protect Ash
- **4.4:** Save MP for Dallas's car, get RAMEN first
- **4.5:** Split party with healers, kill Death Angels Turn 2-3

**Class Advancement:**
- Visit Dojo after 4.1 or 4.2 when hit Level 20
- Final classes make huge difference
- Duelist > Guardsman (movement!)
- Enchanter Phase Shift dominates

- Khanos becomes inaccessible after battle
- Missing opportunity to shop
- Underpowered for later battles

**❌ Missing RAMEN:**
- Only available in 4.4
- Required for Chaos Key
- Locks out Trial #4 forever

**❌ Not Moving Box in 4.1:**
- Kurtz charges immediately
- Three groups at once = overwhelming
- Likely party wipe

**❌ Forgetting Prisms in Trials:**
- Killing all enemies before collecting
- Battle ends, prism lost forever
- Cannot retry Trials

**❌ Imbalanced Split Party in 4.5:**
- Both healers in one group
- Other group has no healing
- Time limit + no healing = failure

### Next Steps

- Royal Ring obtained
- Kira rescued and rejoined
- 4 of 6 Prisms collected
- Act 5 ahead: "The Legacy"
- Logos Trial becomes available

**Preparation for Act 5:**
