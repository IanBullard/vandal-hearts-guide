|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| Deathangel (Ma) | 2 | 18 | 104 | 43 | 36 | 80 | THUNDER BALL R5, HARMFUL WAVE R5 |
| Eggworm (Bo) | 4 | 18 | 119 | 66 | 53 | 63 | None |

**Total Gold:** 17,100 G

**Total Enemies:** 15 (14 regular + 1 Mimic)

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (2 total - 1 is MIMIC!):**

| Location | Coordinates | Contents | Safe? |
|:---------|:------------|:---------|:------|
| NW area | (7,22) | **MIMIC** | ❌ Fake chest! Level 21 monster |
| NE corner | (16,22) | PLATE (Mail) | ✓ Safe - Requires crate pushing |

{: .danger }
> **Mimic Warning:** One of the two chests contains a Level 21 Mimic! It will attack when opened.

**Hidden Items:** None

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Medium - "Very basic" / "Only first 2 rounds are nasty"

The challenge is the difficult opening (starting on ship, enemies on land), followed by a crate-pushing puzzle to reach the NE chest.

#### Map Layout

**Starting Position:**
- Party begins **on the ship**
- Enemies are on **dock and land areas**
- Two main routes to shore: West (direct) and East (treasure route)
- **Crate** on ship can be pushed for puzzle

**Terrain Features:**
- **Dock area:** Winding walkways with multiple levels
- **Ship plank:** Single-tile bridge from ship to dock
- **Crate:** Must be pushed to reach NE chest

#### Phase 1: Opening Assault (Turns 1-2) - NASTY

{: .danger }
> **Difficult Opening:** First 2 rounds are dangerous! Concentrated enemy firepower on narrow dock.

**Turn 1 - Positioning:**

**Party Deployment:**
1. **Move entire party to left (west) side of ship**
2. **Sorcerors at front** - Zohar and Eleni
3. **Archers behind** - Diego, Amon, Darius
4. **ONLY step on 1st plank off ship!** - Don't advance further yet
5. **Everyone else** stays on ship in support range

**Why This Works:**
- Concentrates ranged firepower
- Magic users in front can cast without obstruction
- Archers provide covering fire
- Narrow plank prevents being surrounded

**Turn 2 - Magic Barrage:**

{: .important }
> **Critical Turn:** "Go in blazing with a couple of Phase Shifts right in the middle of the enemy"

**Zohar/Eleni (Enchanters):**
1. **Phase Shift** into enemy masses on dock
2. Target middle of enemy formation (hits 3-4 enemies)
3. Two Phase Shifts = massive damage to grouped enemies
4. ~100+ damage to Gold Golems (armor class weakness)
5. ~50-70 damage to other types

**Priority Targets:**
1. **Death Angels FIRST** - HARMFUL WAVE range 5, dangerous AOE
2. **Eggworms SECOND** - Flying archers, high mobility
3. Acid Ghosts third
4. Golems/Skeletons last

**Archers:**
1. Fire into weakened enemies
2. Finish off wounded from Phase Shifts
3. Focus on Deathangels if still alive

#### Phase 2: Landing & Cleanup (Turns 3-5)

**Bring Full Party Ashore:**
1. Magic users advance to dock
2. Physical fighters follow
3. Healers maintain support positions
4. Flying units prepare for flanking

**Standard Combat:**
- Remaining enemies are manageable
- Use positional advantage (dock elevation)
- Gold Golems weak to magic
- Acid Ghosts inflict poison (annoying but not deadly)

**Mimic Chest:**
- One chest contains Level 21 Mimic (143 HP)
- Only open if prepared for combat
- Gang up with 3-4 characters
- Not essential to open

#### Phase 3: Crate Pushing Puzzle (Turns 5-10)

{: .note }
> **Post-Combat Puzzle:** "After first 2 rounds, it's about maneuvering the crate to reach the NE chest!"

**Objective:** Push crate from ship to NE corner to access PLATE Mail chest

**Execution:**

**Step 1 - Leave One Enemy Alive:**
1. Kill all enemies **except one Gold Golem** (farthest east one)
2. This is your "insurance enemy" so battle doesn't end
3. Play keep-away with this Golem while pushing crate

**Step 2 - Get Crate Off Ship:**
1. Use most mobile characters (Hawknights, Monks, Ninjas)
2. Position behind crate on ship
3. Push crate onto dock

**Step 3 - Navigate to NE:**
1. **Push crate all the way to NE corner**
2. Must navigate dock layout carefully
3. Don't trap crate in corners!
4. Takes several turns of pushing

**Step 4 - Reach Chest:**
1. Crate reaches NE area near (16,22)
2. Use crate to access elevated chest
3. Open → **PLATE Mail**
4. Good armor piece

**Step 5 - Finish:**
1. Kill remaining Golem
2. Victory!

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Advancing Too Fast Turn 1:**
- Rushing onto dock
- Getting surrounded by enemies
- Multiple enemies gang up = quick death

**❌ Not Prioritizing Deathangels:**
- HARMFUL WAVE R5 hits area
- Can devastate party if left alive
- Must kill Turns 1-2

**❌ Forgetting to Leave Enemy for Crate:**
- Killing all enemies before pushing crate
- Battle ends, can't get PLATE Mail
- Need insurance enemy alive

**❌ Trapping Crate:**
- Pushing into corner
- Can't maneuver to NE
- Puzzle fails

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Party to west side of ship
- Phase Shift × 2 Turn 2
- Kill Deathangels immediately
- Leave 1 Golem for crate time
- Push crate to NE methodically
- Get PLATE Mail
- Kill last enemy

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**

**Scene: Pioneer Town Sorbo:**
- Party arrives at Pioneer Town for rest

- **Sabrina informs Kane: his father was murdered**
- Kane has personal crisis
- Kane runs off (emotional breakdown)
- Party left to fight **Kurtz** instead

**Recommended Level:** 22
**Map Size:** 32×16 grid (wide map)
**Victory Condition:** Defeat of Kurtz

| C. Shooter (Bo) | 2 | 21 | 138 | 76 | 61 | 72 | None |

**Total Gold:** 21,420 G

**Total Enemies:** 16

### Boss: Kurtz War Master

**Stats:**
- Level 23 (vs 21 in Act 4.1)
- 156 HP, AT 75, DF 70, AGL 95
- DAGGER STORM R5 - hits all adjacent tiles
  - ~70 damage to each target
  - Area attack that can hit 4-8 characters
- Monk class (final tier)

{: .warning }
> **Boss Threat:** Kurtz spams Dagger Storm constantly. Don't cluster characters around him!

**Support Units:**
- **2 Priests** - Keep healing Kurtz and other units ("those healers suck")
- **1 Warlock** - Rolling Thunder and Magic Arrow dangerous
- **4 C. Armors** - Heavy defense, block access
- **6 C. Hawks** - Flying units, high mobility
- **2 C. Shooters** - Ranged attacks

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items (2):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|
| (29,12) | HELSTONE | NE corner, 3 paw prints tile in snow |
| (0,7) | MITHRIL | W edge, 3 paw prints tile in snow |

{: .note }
> **Snow Tracks:** Both secrets marked by "3 paw prints" tiles in the snow - distinctive visual markers.

**Boss Drop:**
- **Panzer Claws** (P.CLAWS) - Automatic reward for defeating Kurtz
- ATK +20, Value 1,200 G
- Excellent Monk/Ninja weapon

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Hard - "Actually quite hard"

This battle has multiple phases and requires careful coordination. The bridge mechanic, flying enemies, and healer support make this challenging.

#### Map Layout

**Terrain:**
- **Bridge** connects party start to Kurtz's position
- **Snow terrain** on sides (slows movement)
- **Hill** where Kurtz starts (elevated position)
- **Button** at hill base - **detonates bridge!**

{: .danger }
> **Bridge Detonation:** Button at Kurtz's hill foot **DETONATES THE BRIDGE**, instantly killing any unit on it (no EXP)! Can use strategically.

#### Phase 1: Rear Guard (Turn 1)

**Starting Position:**
- Party begins on bridge (west side)
- **4 C. Armors + 1 C. Priest** behind you (west of bridge)
- Main force ahead (Kurtz on hill)

**Turn 1 - Deal with Rear:**

**Zohar/Eleni:**
1. Turn around toward Armors behind party
2. **Phase Shift** into Armored group
   - "VERY susceptible to magic"
   - 100+ damage to each Armor
   - One-shots or near one-shots them
3. Armor class weakness to magic dominates

**Physical Units:**
1. Finish wounded Armors
2. Kill Priest (stops healing)
3. **Get Helstone secret** in NE corner (29,12)
   - Send fast unit to paw prints tile in snow
   - Search → HELSTONE

**Result:** Rear guard eliminated Turn 1-2

#### Phase 2: Bridge Crossing & Hawks (Turns 2-4)

**Critical Decision: Bridge Detonation**

**Option A - Detonate Bridge (Strategic):**
1. Get your party OFF bridge toward Kurtz's hill
2. Someone hits button at hill base
3. Bridge explodes
4. **C. Armors** (if any surviving) forced to take long route through snow
5. Slows their arrival significantly

**Option B - Keep Bridge (Standard):**
1. Don't detonate
2. Face enemies head-on
3. Armors can reach quickly

**Recommended:** Detonate once party is across

**Hawks Engage (Turns 2-4):**

{: .warning }
> **Protect Flying Units:** Keep Hawknights out of Shooter range initially! Hold them back on bridge until southern area is safe.

**Positioning:**
1. **Move halfway across bridge** (don't rush to hill)
2. **Wait for Hawks to get close**
3. Position party at bridge/land junction
4. **Kill ALL Hawks before advancing**

**Anti-Hawk Tactics:**

**Phase Shift Dominance:**
1. Zohar/Eleni position for AOE magic
2. **Phase Shift** when 3+ Hawks grouped
3. ~60-70 damage to each Hawk (180 HP total)
4. Weakens them for arrow finish

**Archer Focus Fire:**
1. Diego, Amon, Darius concentrate fire
2. Each Hawk takes 2-3 arrows
3. "Use archers in counterattack positions"
4. Hawks approach = counterattack + your turn attack = dead

{: .danger }
> **Sword-User Warning:** "Sword-users will be 2HKO'd" - Keep melee units AWAY from Hawks! They hit hard (AT 116).

**Elevation Advantage:**
- You can shoot OVER the hill to hit enemies beyond
- Use this for early Hawk elimination
- Position at east edge of Kurtz's hill approach

**Turn 4 Check:** All 6 Hawks should be dead before advancing to hill

#### Phase 3: Hill Assault - Warlock & Shooters (Turns 5-6)

**Advance to Hill Base:**
1. Party moves toward Kurtz's elevated position
2. Flying units can now advance safely
3. Stay grouped for healing

**Priority Target: Warlock**

{: .important }
> **Kill Warlock First:** "When he moves to hill edge for Rolling Thunder" - eliminate immediately!

**C. Warlock Threat:**
- ROLLING THUNDER - Long-range AOE damage
- MAGIC ARROW - Single-target magic damage
- Will position at hill edge for maximum range
- Low HP (121) = easy kill if you reach him

**Execution:**
1. **Hawknights** advance to Warlock
2. Melee or ranged attack depending on position
3. One-shot him (low HP, low DF)
4. Eliminates magical threat

**C. Shooters:**
1. Secondary priority after Warlock
2. Standard archer threats
3. 2-3 attacks each to kill
4. Keep Hawknights away until Shooters dead

#### Phase 4: Hill Ascent - Priests (Turns 7-8)

**Priest Problem:**

{: .warning }
> **Healing Spam:** Priests keep healing Kurtz and other units! "Don't bother with Shooters unless you KNOW you can take one out in one round (Damn Priest!)"

**2 C. Priests:**
- EXTRA HEALING R5 - restores ~40-50 HP
- Will heal Kurtz, Shooters, each other
- Must eliminate before Kurtz push

**Tactics:**

**Hug Wall Strategy:**
1. **"Hug wall & keep group tight for easy healing"**
2. Move along hill side (not exposed center)
3. Tight formation = easy Ultra Healing reach
4. Approach priests systematically

**Priest Elimination:**
1. **Flying units** best for reaching them
   - "Move your Hawknight(s) around to kill Priest"
2. Get in close to hill
3. **"Nail the Shooters (an Avalanche & arrow work perfect!)"**
   - Kill both Priests and Shooters together
4. Use Avalanche (Ash's spell?) or Phase Shift

**Get Mithril Secret:**
- While flying units maneuvering, grab (0,7) secret
- W end of map, paw prints in snow
- Search → MITHRIL

#### Phase 5: Kurtz Boss Fight (Turns 9-10)

**After Support Eliminated:**
- All Hawks dead
- Warlock dead
- Priests dead
- Shooters dead (or can be ignored)
- Only Kurtz remains

**Boss Fight:**

{: .note }
> **Kurtz Assessment:** "Less powerful than expected" once supports are gone.

**Dagger Storm Mechanic:**
- **Kurtz spams Dagger Storm constantly**
- "Whether surrounded or not" - he'll use it
- Hits all adjacent tiles (1-space away)
- ~70 damage per hit

**Counter-Strategy:**

**Don't Cluster!**
1. **DO NOT put 4+ characters adjacent to Kurtz**
2. Spread attackers around him (not all touching)
3. This limits Dagger Storm targets

**Healing Ready:**
1. Sara/Huxley **keep Ultra Healing ready**
2. Heal immediately after Dagger Storm
3. Multiple priests make this manageable

**Attack Pattern:**
1. 2-3 physical attackers engage
2. Magic from distance (Phase Shift, ranged spells)
3. Archers fire from range
4. Rotate damaged characters out, fresh ones in
5. Sustained assault kills him in 2-3 turns

**Kurtz Stats:**
- 156 HP = not that high for boss
- DF 70 = moderate (good weapons cut through)
- Once he can't heal (Priests dead), goes down fast

### Alternative Strategies

**Wasted EXP Hunt:**
- If you detonated bridge, C. Armors may not reach battle
- They slowly walk through snow
- Hunt them down if you want EXP
- Not necessary for victory

**All-Out Rush:**
- Ignore rear Armors entirely
- Rush across bridge immediately
- Detonate bridge Turn 1
- Fight only forward enemies
- Faster but misses some EXP/items

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Not Killing Hawks First:**
- Advancing to hill with Hawks alive
- Get attacked from behind
- Flying mobility = backstabs

**❌ Trying to Kill Shooters with Priest Alive:**
- "Don't bother unless you can one-round them"
- Priest heals them
- Wasted actions

**❌ Clustering vs Kurtz:**
- 5-6 characters surrounding him
- Dagger Storm hits all
- Party-wide ~350-420 damage
- Wipe potential

**❌ Ignoring Rear Armors:**
- Leaving them alive
- Get sandwiched between two forces
- Hard to heal both fronts

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Phase Shift rear Armors Turn 1
- Kill all Hawks before advancing (Turns 2-4)
- Hug wall approaching hill
- Kill Warlock immediately
- Eliminate both Priests before Kurtz
- Spread out vs Kurtz, don't cluster
- Ultra Healing after each Dagger Storm
- Collect both snow track secrets

- 21,420 G
- **Panzer Claws** (boss drop)

**Story Events:**

{: .note }
> **Party Management:** "Remember that the guys you picked up along the way, may be dying alot cuz you havent upgraded them fully. They can be upgraded at any time, and after 20, you can upgrade them twice in a row."

## Battle 5.2: Tsukue Plains - Field Rescue

**Recommended Level:** 23
**Map Size:** 24×24 grid
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .important }
> **Save Leena and Villager!** NPCs are present and should be protected (though not required for victory).

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| Gold Golem (Ar) | 6 | 22 | 184 | 103 | 111 | 60 | None |
| Skeleton (Kn) | 2 | 22 | 161 | 91 | 79 | 79 | None |
| Eggworm (Bo) | 3 | 22 | 144 | 79 | 63 | 75 | None |
| Acid Ghost (Ai) | 2 | 22 | 172 | 111 | 87 | 84 | Poison attacks |
| Deathangel (Ma) | 2 | 22 | 126 | 51 | 43 | 96 | THUNDER BALL R5, HARMFUL WAVE R5 |
| **Mimic** (Mo) | 1 | 23 | 156 | 75 | 70 | 90 | **Hidden in chest!** |

**Total Gold:** 22,080 G

**Total Enemies:** 16

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (1):**

| Location | Coordinates | Contents | Safe? |
|:---------|:------------|:---------|:------|
| Center | (12,12) | **MIMIC** | ❌ Fake chest! Level 23 monster |

{: .danger }
> **Mimic Warning:** The only chest contains a Mimic! Don't open unless prepared for combat.

**Hidden Items:** None

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Easy/Medium - "Pretty easy compared to some"

This is a relatively straightforward battle with standard enemy types. The main consideration is splitting the party to cover both sides of the map.

#### Map Layout

**Terrain:**
- Fields and plains
- Three enemy groups: North, East, Middle
- Mimic chest in middle area
- Multi-level terrain (hills)

**Enemy Positioning:**
- **North group:** Golems and support
- **East group:** Mixed forces
- **Middle group:** Near treasure chest

#### Recommended Strategy: Two Groups

{: .important }
> **Author's Formation:** "I formed 2 groups, with a healer in each."

**Split Party:**
- **Group 1:** 5-6 characters with Sara (healer)
- **Group 2:** 5-6 characters with Huxley (healer)

**Composition Each Group:**
- 2-3 physical attackers (Knights, etc.)
- 1-2 ranged units (Archers)
- 1 magic user (Enchanter)
- 1 healer (Archbishop)

{: .note }
> **Enchanter Value:** "Enchanter units very helpful" - Author had 2 (Zohar and Eleni), one per group.

#### Phase 1: Approach & Engage (Turns 1-3)

**Western Wall Route:**

{: .important }
> **Best Path:** "Head along extreme west wall (easiest height progression)"

**Group 1 - West Wall:**
1. Move along extreme western wall
2. Easiest elevation progression
3. Engage **North group** first
4. High ground advantage

**Group 2 - Direct Center:**
1. Move toward middle/east
2. Engage **Middle group** near chest
3. Can move toward **East group** after

**Priority Targets:**
1. **Death Angels first** (both groups)
   - HARMFUL WAVE R5 AOE threat
   - Low HP (126) = easier to kill
   - "Priority Target: Death Angels"
2. Acid Ghosts second (poison annoying)
3. Eggworms third (flying archers)
4. Gold Golems fourth (slow, weak to magic)
5. Skeletons last (standard melee)

#### Phase 2: Death Angel Elimination (Turns 2-4)

**Critical Priority:**

{: .danger }
> **Kill Death Angels ASAP:** "Beware of Deathangels & Eggworms and everything should run smoothly"

**Death Angel Threat:**
- HARMFUL WAVE R5 - 5-tile range AOE
- THUNDER BALL R5 - Single target ~70 damage
- Can devastate party if left alive
- Both groups have 1 Death Angel each

**Each Group's Execution:**

**Archers:**
1. Focus fire on group's Death Angel
2. 2-3 arrows typically kill (126 HP)
3. Sniper class excellent for this

**Magic:**
1. Phase Shift if Death Angel near other enemies
2. Piercing Light single-target if isolated
3. ~70-80 damage from Enchanter magic

**Quick Kill:**
- Death Angel should die Turn 2-3 per group
- Once dead, pressure drops significantly

#### Phase 3: Golem Elimination (Turns 3-6)

**Gold Golems:**
- 6 total (most numerous enemy)
- High HP (184) and high DF (111)
- Armor class = **weak to magic**
- Slow movement (AGL 60)

**Phase Shift Dominance:**

{: .note }
> **Magic Effectiveness:** "Gold Golems from middle can be Phase Shifted easily from western position"

**Zohar/Eleni:**
1. **Phase Shift** into Golem groups
2. 100+ damage to each
3. One-shots or near one-shots
4. Can hit 2-3 Golems at once
5. "Golem types weak to magic"

**Physical Cleanup:**
1. Wounded Golems finished by physical attacks
2. Slow movement = they come to you
3. Don't rush - let them approach
4. "Stall tactics work well - easily surmountable forces"

#### Phase 4: Mimic & Cleanup (Turns 6-8)

**Mimic Chest:**
- Location: Center at (12,12)
- Contains Level 23 Mimic (156 HP)
- **Optional to open**

**If Opening:**
1. Kill nearby enemies first
2. Gang up with 3-4 characters
3. Mimic has decent stats (AT 75)
4. One-shot or two-shot with focused fire

**Or Skip:**
- Not essential to open
- "Avoid it if taking damage"
- No reward worth the risk

**Final Enemies:**
- Once Death Angels dead, battle is easy
- **Far eastern group** eventually approaches
- Pick them off with arrows as they advance
- Standard cleanup

**Convergence:**
1. Two groups meet in middle
2. Eliminate stragglers together
3. Victory when all 16 dead (including Mimic if opened)

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Not Splitting Party:**
- Keeping all 12 together
- Can't cover both sides efficiently
- One enemy group ignored too long

**❌ Fighting Both Groups Simultaneously:**
- "Engage groups one at a time - both at once is foolish"
- Getting surrounded
- Healing can't keep up

**❌ Ignoring Death Angels:**
- Letting them cast HARMFUL WAVE repeatedly
- Party-wide damage accumulates
- Quick wipe

**❌ Physical Attacks on Golems:**
- Wasting turns hitting high-DF enemies
- Use Phase Shift instead
- Much more efficient

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Split into 2 balanced groups (healer each)
- West wall route (easiest elevation)
- Kill Death Angels immediately (Turns 2-3)

**Total Gold:** 24,320 G

**Total Enemies:** 15

### Boss: Salamander (Red Dragon)

**Stats:**
- Level 26, 202 HP
- AT 130 (very high!), DF 102, AGL 98
- **Flying type** (Airman class)
- **No spells** - purely physical attacks
- High mobility

{: .warning }
> **Boss Weakness:** "Dragon dies very easily! Don't accidentally kill him before collecting treasures." Despite stats, he's surprisingly fragile.

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (1):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Notes |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:------|
| Near box stack | (13,6) | D.SPEAR | Dragon Spear - requires box puzzle |

**Hidden Items (1):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description | Notes |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|:------|
| (15,13) | **LOGOS KEY** | Middle of smallest lava pool | **TRIAL #5 KEY!** **FLYING UNIT REQUIRED!** |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL - MISSABLE ITEM:** **LOGOS KEY** can ONLY be obtained in this battle! Requires **Hawknight or Sky Lord** to fly over lava! Missing it locks you out of Trial #5 forever!

**Boss Drop:**
- **Wyrmfang** (WYRMFANG) - Automatic reward for defeating Salamander
- Powerful spell item with massive AOE
- Can also be purchased for 16,000 G later

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Easy - "Relatively easy" / "This ones also relatively easy"

Despite being a dragon boss battle, this is surprisingly straightforward. The challenge is collecting treasures before accidentally killing the dragon.

#### Map Layout

**Terrain:**
- **Lava pools** scattered throughout cave
- **Twisting path** through lava areas
- **Boxes** (crates) for Dragon Spear puzzle
- **Elevated positions** for tactical advantage
- Salamander in northeastern area

**Lava Pools:**
- Multiple pools of various sizes
- **Smallest lava pool** northeast contains LOGOS KEY
- Only **flying units** can cross lava

{: .important }
> **Location Details:** "5 spaces west of Salamander's starting position, 2 spaces south" = Logos Key location in smallest lava pond

#### Recommended Strategy: Defensive Chokepoint

**Chokepoint Advantage:**

{: .note }
> **Positioning:** "Tile north of Ash's starting location is a strong chokepoint (high ground)"

**Execution:**
1. **Ash moves one tile north** from start
2. **Rest of party stays in beginning area**
3. **ALL enemies (except Salamander) will come to you**
4. High ground advantage
5. 3 enemies north can be blocked with only 2 units
6. Salamander stays put (intentional for key collection!)

**Why This Works:**
- Defensive position with height advantage
- Enemies funnel through chokepoint
- Salamander doesn't move = time to get key
- Control battle flow

#### Phase 1: Initial Rush (Turn 1)

**Alternative Aggressive Start:**

{: .note }
> **Author's Approach:** "I got a group over to the enemies directly across from you right away, and killed them in 1 turn."

**Aggressive Option:**
1. Send 5-6 characters rushing north
2. Burst damage into 3 enemies directly ahead
3. **Kill them in 1 turn** (magic + physical combo)
4. Then "just marched ahead"

**Or Defensive:**
1. Move Ash 1 tile north
2. Everyone else stays back
3. Let enemies approach
4. Safer but slower

#### Phase 2: Send Flying Unit for LOGOS KEY (Turn 1-2!)

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL TIMING:** Send flying unit for key **IMMEDIATELY!** "THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE TO GET THE KEY!"

**Flying Unit Mission (Diego/Kira):**

**Requirements:**
- **MUST be Hawknight or Sky Lord** class
- Only flying units can cross lava
- Author used Diego as Sky Lord

**Turn 1-2 Execution:**
1. **Flying unit breaks off from main party**
2. **Fly toward northeastern lava pools**
3. Navigate to **smallest lava pool**
4. **Location:** (15,13)
   - "Middle of smallest lava lake nearest dragon"
   - "Center tile of smallest lava pool"
   - 5 spaces W, 2 spaces S of Salamander start
5. **Search → LOGOS KEY**
6. **VERIFY IN INVENTORY!**

{: .important }
> **Tavern Hint Reference:** "Use a Sky Lord to look in the center tile of the smallest lava lake near Salamander. It contains the LOGOS KEY."

**While Flying Unit on Mission:**
- Main party fights regular enemies
- Salamander stays put (doesn't approach)
- This gives time to collect key safely
- Don't kill Salamander until key secured!

#### Phase 3: Dragon Spear Collection (Turns 3-5)

**Box Puzzle:**

**D.Spear Chest Location:** Near stack of boxes at (13,6)

**Box Puzzle Solution:**

**Step 1 - Kill Nearby Enemies:**
1. Eliminate **Eggworm** & **Acid Ghost** near boxes
2. Clear area for maneuvering

**Step 2 - Initial Box:**
1. **Move Sky Lord** to lone box (isolated crate)
2. **Push lone box 2 spaces north**
3. Next turn: **jump on top of box** (use it as platform)

**Step 3 - Stack Push:**
1. Character now on elevated box
2. **Push huge stack of boxes east** repeatedly
3. Multiple turns of pushing
4. Creates access to higher elevation

**Step 4 - Reach Chest:**
1. **Mount the stack** after sufficient pushing
2. Walk across to reach chest
3. Open → **D.Spear** (Dragon Spear)
4. Excellent spear weapon

**Or Skip:**
- Not essential if difficult
- Can buy similar weapons later
- Focus on Logos Key (more important)

#### Phase 4: Regular Enemy Elimination (Turns 2-6)

**While collecting items, fight enemies:**

**Gold Golems:**
- 4 total
- Weak to Phase Shift magic
- 100+ damage per cast
- Easy elimination

**Acid Ghosts:**
- Flying poison attackers
- Shoot with archers
- Phase Shift also effective

**Eggworms:**
- Flying archers
- Similar to Acid Ghosts
- Priority after Death Angels (none here)

**Skeletons:**
- Standard melee
- Counterattack effectively
- Low threat

**General Combat:**
- Let them approach chokepoint
- Phase Shift grouped enemies
- Archers pick off flyers
- Standard cleanup

#### Phase 5: Salamander Dragon (Turn 7+)

**After All Items Secured:**

{: .danger }
> **Verify Before Killing:** "Make sure you get chest & secret before killing dragon! He's terribly easy to kill even in self-defense!"

**Checklist:**
- ✅ LOGOS KEY collected (most important!)
- ✅ D.Spear collected (optional)
- ✅ All regular enemies dead
- Ready to fight Salamander

**Dragon Fight:**

**Approach:**
1. Advance party toward Salamander's position
2. He's been waiting in NE area
3. Surround him

**Execution:**

**Magic:**
1. Phase Shift from Enchanters
2. ~70-80 damage (not as effective as vs Armor)
3. Flying type = moderate magic resistance

**Physical:**
1. Multiple melee attackers
2. High AT (130) means he hits back hard
3. But only 202 HP = goes down in 2-3 turns
4. Focus fire

**Archers:**
1. Long-range shots
2. Safe attacks from distance
3. Good damage to flying type

**Surprisingly Easy:**
- Despite high stats, not that threatening
- Doesn't have special attacks
- No healing
- Physical only
- Dies faster than expected

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Forgetting LOGOS KEY:**
- Killing Salamander first
- Battle ends, can't get key
- **Permanently missable!**
- Locked out of Trial #5 forever

**❌ No Flying Unit:**
- Bringing party without Hawknight/Sky Lord
- Can't cross lava to reach key
- Can't complete key collection
- Major mistake

**❌ Accidentally Killing Salamander:**
- "He's terribly easy to kill even in self-defense!"
- AOE spells might hit him
- Counterattacks might kill him
- Get items first!

**❌ Forgetting Box Puzzle:**
- Not getting D.Spear
- Missing good weapon
- Less critical than key but still good

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- IMMEDIATELY send flying unit for LOGOS KEY (Turn 1-2)
- Verify key collected
- Box puzzle for D.Spear (optional)
- Let enemies come to you
- Kill Salamander LAST
- Double-check inventory before finishing

### Post-Battle

**Rewards:**
- 24,320 G
- **Wyrmfang** (boss drop)
- **LOGOS KEY** in inventory (if collected)

**Story Events:**

**Scene: Frontier Village Returns:**
- Party returns from dragon hunt
- **Village is in flames!** (Eleni's premonition was true!)
- "Frontier Village in flames (Surprise!?!)"
- Attack underway
- **Orosius mortally wounded** (dying)

**Next Battle Immediate:** Fight begins at burning village

| (10,1) | MITHRIL | SW area, crack in sidewalk by S house |
| (31,5) | SHIVBOOK | SE area, crack in sidewalk by E house, N side |

{: .note }
> Both secrets are "pavement crack" tiles - visual markers on ground.

**Boss Drop:**
- **Rune Bow** - Automatic reward for defeating Sabina
- ATK +25, Value 3,400 G
- Best bow before end-game equipment
- "Very powerful!"

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Hard - "Definitely hard, but do-able" / "Now things get NASTY"

This is one of the hardest battles in Act 5 due to the two-phase structure, heavy armor enemies, multiple healers, and reinforcements.

#### Map Layout

**Terrain:**
- **Burning village** (destroyed Frontier Village)
- **Riverbed** (dry sluiceway) runs through middle
- **Houses** and wreckage provide cover
- **Switch** controls flood mechanism
- **North bridge** has boulder that can be kicked

**Key Features:**
- **Riverbed Trap:** Can be flooded with switch
- **Northern House:** Provides cover and high ground
- **Two Main Sections:** Armor/Shooter area (SW) and Sabina's area (NE)

#### Phase 1: First Stretch - Armors & Shooters (Turns 1-3)

**Starting Position:**
- Party enters from west
- **9 C. Armors** in/near riverbed (SW)
- **4 C. Shooters** on elevated positions
- **Priests** scattered for healing
- **Warlocks** in support

**Turn 1-2 - Enter Riverbed:**

{: .note }
> **Initial Tactic:** "Move party towards Shooters and out of riverbed"

**Execution:**
1. **Enter dry sluiceway** (riverbed)
2. **Don't stay in riverbed!** - it's a trap
3. Move toward Shooters (elevated positions)
4. **Send someone to get Mithril secret** (10,1)
   - SW area by southern house
   - Pavement crack
   - Search → MITHRIL

**Combat Focus:**

**Magic Bombardment:**
1. **Roman Fire** and **Phase Shift** into armored units
2. Armor class weak to magic
3. 100+ damage per hit
4. "Bombard armored units with Roman Flame and arrows"

**Archer Support:**
1. Focus on Shooters (elevated positions)
2. Kill Shooters in 1 round if possible
3. "MUST defeat them in 1 round to be effective"
4. Otherwise Priests heal them back

**Special Positioning:**
> **Tactic:** "Units against sluiceway's east railing can't be hit by projectiles - place flying units there"

- East railing = safe zone from projectiles
- Flying units protected position
- Can attack without being shot

**Priest Priority:**
- "Kill Warlocks and Priests ASAP"
- Prevent healing and magic damage
- EXTRA HEALING range 5 = they'll heal Armors
- Must eliminate before they undo your damage

**Bishop Holy Pressure:**
> "Use Bishops' Holy Pressure to hit both armored groups (prevents priest healing)"

- Archbishop offensive spell
- Can hit multiple enemies
- Interrupts healing capability
- Good for area control

#### Turn 4: Kane's Reinforcements Arrive!

{: .danger }
> **SURPRISE REINFORCEMENTS:** "Turn 4: Kane's men show up" - 6 new enemies including Kane boss!

**Kane's Force:**
- **Kane Assassin** (boss)
- 3 C. Knights
- 2 C. Hawks
- Arrive near north screen by sluice button

**Immediate Problem:**
- All remaining Armor guards now in riverbed
- Your party potentially surrounded
- Two boss fights at once

#### Turn 4: Flood Mechanic

{: .important }
> **River Flood Switch:** "Press switch" to flood riverbed, instantly killing guards inside!

**Switch Mechanic:**
1. **All guards now in riverbed** (Turn 4)
2. Someone presses **switch** near north sluice
3. **Flood them instantly**
4. All enemies in riverbed die (no EXP)
5. "Clean up surrounding enemies" afterward

**Strategic Decision:**

**Option A - Flood (Fast):**
- Press switch Turn 4
- Instant kill on remaining Armors
- Miss EXP but easier
- Recommended for first-time players

**Option B - Fight (Max EXP):**
- Don't flood
- Kill Armors manually
- More EXP and gold
- Harder but more rewarding

**Boulder Alternative:**
> "Lead them into groove, kick boulder near north bridge, wash them away (why bother though?)"

- Can kick boulder too
- Same effect as switch
- More complex, less efficient

#### Defensive Fortification Strategy (If Known About Reinforcements)

{: .important }
> **Counter-Strategy:** "Fall back to sluiceway's SW end. Fortify position."

**Advanced Tactic (Turns 2-3):**

**Preparation:**
1. Kill armored units near sluice's **west side** only
2. **Don't advance too far east** in Turns 1-3
3. Turn 3: **Fall back** to SW end of sluiceway
4. **Fortify position** there

**Why This Works:**
1. Puts enemies in watery groove (low ground)
2. You have high ground advantage (SW end)
3. They bunch up in riverbed
4. **Abuse arrows and Roman Fire from high ground**
5. Flanking impossible
6. Can flood when ready

{: .warning }
> **Watch for Hawks:** "Check movement range to prevent backstabs" - Flying enemies can flank!

#### Phase 2: Second Stretch - Sabina's Group (Turns 5-8)

**After Handling Reinforcements:**
- Kane's group defeated or in progress
- Armors flooded or killed
- Time to advance on Sabina

**Preparation (Turn 5-6):**
1. **Collect Mithril** if not already done
2. **Heal up** - Ultra Healing all wounded
3. **Restore mages' MP** if low
   - Magic Charge from Bishops
   - Life Orbs if needed
4. Sabina's group "should have waited patiently" in NE

**Advance Strategy:**

**Ground Route:**
1. Send main group **along low street**
2. Approach Sabina's position from ground level
3. Tight formation for healing

**High Ground Magic:**
1. **1-2 mages climb northern house wreckage**
2. Elevated position for "magicbomb" drops
3. Can Phase Shift into Sabina's group from above
4. Height advantage

**Priority Elimination:**

{: .important }
> **Kill Order:** "Priority: Kill Warlocks and Priests ASAP"

**Warlocks:**
- ROLLING THUNDER dangerous
- MAGIC ARROW backup
- Low HP (143)
- Kill first

**Priests:**
- Will heal Sabina and others
- Prevent healing before Sabina fight
- EXTRA HEALING range 5

**Save Sabina for Last:**
> "Save Sabina for last (allows time to dig up Shivbook)"

**Shivbook Collection:**
1. While fighting support units
2. Send character to (31,5)
3. Eastern pavement crack, N side of house
4. Search → SHIVBOOK

#### Boss Fight: Sabina

**After All Supports Dead:**
- Only Sabina remains
- Can now focus entirely on her

**Sabina Tactics:**

**HYPER HEALING Problem:**
- Range 8, Field 2
- Can heal from extreme distance
- ~50-60 HP restored
- No allies to heal = heals self only

**EXP Farming (Optional):**
> "Knows Hyper Healing - extend battle for extra EXP. Play with her to maximize experience before finishing."

- Weaken her below ~100 HP
- She heals self
- Weaken again
- Repeat 2-3 times
- Milk maximum EXP
- Kill when satisfied

**Kill Strategy:**
1. **Surround her** with multiple attackers
2. **Burst damage** to kill before she heals
3. Combined assault: magic + physical + arrows
4. 4-5 attacks simultaneously = death
5. 182 HP = not that tanky for boss

**Alternative:**
- Just kill her normally
- Don't waste time on farming
- Move on to next battle

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Staying in Riverbed Turn 3-4:**
- Getting flooded by own switch
- Or surrounded by Kane's reinforcements
- Tactical disadvantage

**❌ Not Killing Shooters in 1 Round:**
- Priests heal them back
- Wasted attacks
- Frustrating

**❌ Advancing Too Far Before Turn 4:**
- Kane reinforcements appear behind you
- Sandwiched between two forces
- Hard to retreat

**❌ Not Using Flood Mechanic:**
- Fighting all 9 Armors manually
- Much harder than needed
- Switch makes it easy

**❌ Exposing Hawknights:**
- "DON'T leave Hawknights out in the open!"
- Shooters destroy them
- Keep protected until Shooters dead

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Enter riverbed, exit quickly
- Magic destroys Armors
- Kill Shooters in 1 round or leave them
- Kill Priests and Warlocks ASAP
- Fall back SW Turn 3 (if know about reinforcements)
- Flood remaining Armors Turn 4
- Handle Kane's group from fortified position
- Collect both secrets
- Eliminate Sabina's supports first
- Save Sabina for last, burst her down

### Post-Battle

- **44,820 G** - Highest gold in entire game!
- **Rune Bow** (boss drop)

**Story Events:**

**Orosius Dying Scene:**
- Elder is **mortally wounded**

- **Tells Leena:** Go to **Orome Lake**
- Break seal on ancient temple
- **Vandal Heart sword** hidden there
- "Can deal with Flames of Judgment"
- Ultimate weapon quest

**Eleni & Leena:**
- **Eleni gives Leena her pendant**
- Emotional moment

- Foreshadowing time paradox

**Next Destination:** Orome Lake

---

## Battle 5.5: Orome Lake - Temple Guardian Escort

**Recommended Level:** 26
**Map Size:** 28×14 grid
**Victory Condition:** Leena reaches temple entrance
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash or Leena

{: .danger }
> **Escort Mission:** Must protect NPC Leena and guide her to temple entrance safely!

### Enemy Composition

**Progressive Spawns - Four Groups:**

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Notes |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:------|
| Guardian (Ar) | 10 | 24-25 | 200-208 | 112-116 | 121-125 | 65-67 | Spread across 4 groups |
| Basilisk (Bo) | 6 | 23-24 | 151-157 | 83-86 | 66-69 | 79-82 | Spread across 4 groups |

**Total Gold:** 29,120 G

**Total Enemies:** 16 (spawn in 4 groups as Leena advances)

### Spawn Groups

**Group 1 (Initial):**
- 2 Guardians (L25, 208 HP)
- 2 Basilisks (L24, 157 HP)
- Start on field when battle begins

**Group 2 (When Leena reaches (11,2)):**
- 4 Guardians (L24, 200 HP)
- 2 Basilisks (L23, 151 HP)
- +6 enemies spawn

**Group 3 (When Leena reaches (17,11)):**
- 2 Guardians (L24, 200 HP)
- +2 enemies spawn

**Group 4 (Final section):**
- 2 Guardians (L25, 208 HP)
- 2 Basilisks (L24, 157 HP)
- Near finish gate

{: .warning }
> **Progressive Spawns:** "Enemies spawn when Leena reaches specific locations" - (11,2) triggers 6 enemies, (17,11) triggers 2 more!

### Special Mechanic: Guest NPC Escort

**Leena:**
- Guest unit (NPC controlled)
- Moves on her own AI
- Must reach temple entrance gate
- **Her death = defeat!**
- When reaches red circle tile → next walkway section rises

**Walkway Mechanics:**
- Temple path rises in sections
- Leena triggers each section
- "All monsters must be defeated before Leena can proceed to next section"
- Can control her pace by blocking path

{: .important }
> **Control Tactic:** "Stuff up walkways with your units so Leena has nowhere to move (keeps her safe)"

### Enemy Analysis

**Guardian (Armor class):**
- "Close-range bashers"
- "Decent damage"
- **Weak to magic** (armor class)
- 200-208 HP
- Higher DF (121-125)
- Phase Shift one-shots or near one-shots them

**Basilisk (Archer class):**
- "Long-range projectile shooters"
- "Range comparable to Snipers at elevation"
- Flying movement
- "Slightly weak to projectiles"
- 151-157 HP
- Good vs flying units, but vulnerable to arrows

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (2):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Notes |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:------|
| North | (21,13) | GOLD AXE | Northern chest |
| South | (18,1) | WYRMFANG | Southern chest |

{: .note }
> **Get both chests before killing remaining foes** - Battle ends when Leena reaches finish gate!

**Hidden Items:** None

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Easy - "Too easy" / "NONE (Too Easy)"

{: .note }
> **Author's Opinion:** "I thought this was too easy. Sure you raise more enemies, but they are gluttons for punishment."

Despite being an escort mission, this is surprisingly simple due to weak enemy types and controllable pacing.

#### Recommended Strategy: Controlled Advance

**Core Concept:**
- **Control Leena's movement speed**
- Kill all enemies in section before she advances
- This prevents being overwhelmed
- Safe, systematic progression

#### Phase 1: Initial Group (Turns 1-2)

**Group 1 Enemies:**
- 2 Guardians + 2 Basilisks
- On mainland when battle starts

**Turn 1 - Engage:**

**Magic Assault:**
1. **Phase Shift** into Guardians
   - Armor class weakness
   - ~100+ damage each
   - One-shots them
2. "Salamander" spell mentioned (fire AOE)
   - If available, use on grouped enemies

**Archer Focus:**
1. Shoot Basilisks (flying archers)
2. 2-3 arrows each
3. "They're dead" - not threatening

**Leena Control:**
1. **Block walkway** with your units
2. Don't let her advance yet
3. Keep her safe in starting area

**Turn 2 - Cleanup:**
- Finish any wounded enemies
- Verify all Group 1 dead
- Prepare for advance

#### Phase 2: Trigger Group 2 (Turns 3-5)

**When Ready:**
1. Clear path for Leena
2. Let her move to trigger tile **(11,2)**
3. **Group 2 spawns:** +6 enemies (4 Guardians + 2 Basilisks)

**Combat Tactics:**

**Phase Shift Spam:**
> "They are gluttons for punishment"

1. Zohar/Eleni **Phase Shift** into Guardians
2. Multiple Guardians die per cast
3. Armor weakness dominates

**Archer Support:**
1. Diego, Amon, Darius shoot Basilisks
2. Flying vs flying effective
3. "Can be sniped from mainland's elevated land"

**Positioning:**
- "Don't stick units at crossroads where damage can converge"
- Spread out to avoid AOE targeting
- Use mainland elevation for shots

**When 2nd Section Rises:**
> "Enemies teleport near former 'safe zone'"

- New spawn points appear
- Don't get surprised
- Adjust positioning

#### Phase 3: Trigger Group 3 (Turns 6-7)

**Advance Leena:**
1. She moves to **(17,11)** trigger
2. **Group 3 spawns:** +2 Guardians
3. "Connects 1st and 2nd tower areas to exit"

**Combat:**
- Only 2 enemies
- Easy elimination
- Phase Shift or physical attacks
- Simple cleanup

**Stick Together:**
> "Stick to one big group if possible"

- Don't split party
- Easier healing
- Concentrated firepower
- Safer for Leena

#### Phase 4: Final Section & Chests (Turns 8-10)

**Approach Finish Gate:**
1. Leena approaching temple entrance
2. **Group 4:** 2 Guardians + 2 Basilisks near finish
3. **DO NOT let Leena reach finish yet!**

{: .danger }
> **Critical:** "Get both treasure chests before killing remaining foes" - Battle ends when Leena finishes!

**Chest Collection:**

**Gold Axe (North):**
1. Character moves to (21,13)
2. Northern chest
3. Open → GOLD AXE
4. Sellable item

**Wyrmfang (South):**
1. Character moves to (18,1)
2. Southern chest
3. Open → WYRMFANG
4. Spell item (same as boss drop from Salamander)

**Final Enemies:**

{: .note }
> **Salamander Spell Tip:** "Enemies near finish gate can be weakened with Salamander before approaching"

1. If you have Salamander spell (Wyrmfang item)
2. Cast from distance
3. Weakens final group
4. Then approach for cleanup

**Or Standard:**
1. Phase Shift the Guardians
2. Shoot the Basilisks
3. Standard elimination

**Finish:**
1. **Verify both chests collected**
2. Clear path for Leena
3. She walks to temple entrance
4. Victory!

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Letting Leena Run Ahead:**
- She triggers spawns before ready
- Multiple enemy groups active
- Overwhelming

**❌ Not Blocking Walkway:**
- Can't control her movement
- She advances on AI
- Lose control of pacing

**❌ Forgetting Chests:**
- Leena reaches finish
- Battle ends
- Chests inaccessible
- Miss items

**❌ Spreading Out at Crossroads:**
- "Don't stick units at crossroads"
- Convergent damage
- Multiple enemies target one spot

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Block walkway to control Leena
- Kill all enemies in section before advancing
- Phase Shift destroys Guardians
- Arrows eliminate Basilisks
- Get both chests before final enemy dies
- Let Leena finish only when ready

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**

**MAJOR TIME PARADOX REVEAL!**

{: .important }
> **THE BIG TWIST:** "Leena is really Eleni, and Eleni is really Leena."

**Scene:**
- Leena about to unseal Vandal Heart
- **Xeno appears!** (villain entrance)
- Creates **space-time fracture**
- Zaps Leena into temporal rift

**Time Paradox Explained:**

**18 Years Ago:**
- Eleni was an orphan (known from earlier story)
- No family, raised by Magnus

**The Truth:**
- **This Leena IS Eleni from 18 years in the future!**
- Xeno sent her back in time
- She became the orphan child "Eleni"
- That child grew up → became present-day Eleni
- Present Eleni grew up → becomes "Leena" identity
- **Temporal causality loop!**

**Evidence:**
- Eleni's pendant given to Leena (circular)
- Both connected by time displacement
- Mind-bending paradox

**Resolution:**
- Eleni (present) opens case
- **Ash takes Vandal Heart sword**
- Ultimate weapon obtained!

**Rewards:**
- **Vandal Heart** sword and armor set
- Legendary equipment for Ash
- ATK +40 (best weapon in game!)
- Vandal Heart armor also obtained

**End of Act 5**

## Optional: Trial of Logos (Trial #5)

**Unlock Requirement:** LOGOS KEY (from Battle 5.3 - Smoking Bones Cave)
**Recommended Level:** 25-27
**Map Size:** 20×20 grid

{: .note }
> This Trial becomes accessible after Smoking Bones Cave. Detailed strategy available in [Trial of Logos guide](/trials/logos/). This section provides complete battle information.

### How to Access

1. Ensure **LOGOS KEY** is in inventory (from Salamander's cave, lava pool)
2. Give LOGOS KEY to Ash (equip as item)
3. Enter any Dojo
4. Select "Leave" option
5. Dojomaster asks about transformation
6. Select "Yes" to enter Trial

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| Guardian (Ar) | 13 | Scales with Ash | ~216 | Varies | Varies | Varies | None |
| Basilisk (Bo) | 5 | Scales with Ash | ~170 | Varies | Varies | Varies | None |
| Salamander (Ai) | 7 | Scales with Ash | ~202 | Varies | Varies | Varies | None |
| Dark Mage (Ma) | 2 | Scales with Ash | ~148 | Varies | Varies | Varies | DARK HURRICANE R6F1, EVIL STREAM R9 |

**Total Enemies:** 27 (large battle!)

{: .danger }
> **Enemy Scaling:** All enemies scale with Ash's level. At Level 26, enemies are Level 26.

{: .warning }
> **Dark Mages:** 2 Dark Mages have powerful spells! DARK HURRICANE (range 6, field 1) and EVIL STREAM (range 9)!

**Total Gold:** 270 G (minimal)

### Special Note: Translation Error

{: .note }
> **Item Name:** Called "LOGO PRISM" in U/C version, but should be **LOGOS PRISM** to match "LOGOS KEY" naming. Japanese version uses consistent "Logos" naming.

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (1):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Notes |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:------|
| SE area | (17,2) | **LOGOS PRISM** | **Must collect before battle ends!** |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** You MUST collect the LOGOS PRISM before defeating all enemies! If you win without it, you cannot retry this Trial!

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Medium - "EASY but extremely tedious and boring!" (~25 rounds)

The combat itself isn't hard (if fully equipped), but the **spiral tower grind** makes this the most tedious Trial.

#### Map Layout

**Spiral Tower:**
- "This board is simply a huge spiral staircase tower with monsters"
- 27 enemies distributed along spiral
- Single-file path winding upward
- Long climb to top
- Chest at summit (SE area)

#### Recommended Strategy: Single-File March

{: .important }
> **Core Strategy:** "Stay single file against tower wall as you climb"

**Turn-by-Turn:**

**Formation:**
1. **Single-file line** along tower wall
2. Frontline: Knights (high HP/DF)
3. Mid-line: Archers and Monks
4. Rear: Mages and Priests
5. March upward systematically

**Combat Approach:**

**Don't Waste Attack Spells Early:**
> "Don't waste your attack spells until closer to end"

1. **Conserve MP** for later enemies
2. Use physical attacks primarily
3. Archers very effective
4. Save Phase Shift for emergencies

**Dark Mage Priority:**
> "Pause only to put an arrow through the Mages"

1. **Kill Dark Mages ASAP** when encountered
2. DARK HURRICANE and EVIL STREAM dangerous
3. 2-3 arrows should kill them (low HP ~148)
4. Don't let them cast repeatedly

**Guardians (13 total):**
- Armor class = weak to magic
- But conserve MP
- Physical attacks work fine
- High DF but killable with good weapons

**Basilisks (5 total):**
- Flying archers
- Shoot them with your archers
- 2-3 arrows each
- Not threatening

**Salamanders (7 total):**
- Flying dragon-types
- Higher HP (~202)
- 3-4 attacks to kill
- Magic or physical both work

**Pace:**
- ~25 rounds total
- Extremely long grind
- Tedious but not difficult
- Bring healing items

**Phase Shift Usage:**
- Save for grouped enemies near top
- When 3+ enemies clustered
- Late battle when MP less needed
- Speeds up final push

#### Final Push & Prism Collection

**Near Top (Rounds 20-25):**
1. Enemies thinning
2. Chest visible in SE (17,2)
3. **Leave at least 1 enemy alive** as insurance

**Collect Prism:**
1. Character reaches chest
2. **Open → LOGOS PRISM**
3. **VERIFY IN INVENTORY!**

**Finish:**
1. Kill remaining enemies
2. Victory

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Not Conserving MP:**
- Wasting Phase Shift on early enemies
- Running out of MP for Dark Mages
- Tedious ending with no spells

**❌ Spreading Out:**
- Breaking single-file formation
- Getting flanked on spiral
- Healers can't reach frontline

**❌ Ignoring Dark Mages:**
- Letting them cast EVIL STREAM (range 9!)
- Party-wide damage
- Accumulates over time

**❌ Forgetting Prism:**
- Killing all enemies first
- Battle ends, can't get prism
- Locked out of 5th Prism forever

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Single-file against wall
- Physical attacks primarily
- Arrow the Dark Mages immediately
- Conserve MP for emergencies
- Leave 1 enemy for prism
- Verify prism collected
- Kill last enemy

### Post-Trial

**Reward:**
- **LOGOS PRISM** (5/6 Prisms for Vandalier)
- 270 G
- Minimal EXP (scales with Ash)

**Progress:**
- ✅ Nova Prism (Trial #1)
- ✅ Earth Prism (Trial #2)
- ✅ Mana Prism (Trial #3)
- ✅ Chaos Prism (Trial #4)
- ✅ **Logos Prism (Trial #5)** ← Just obtained!
- ⬜ Heaven Prism (Trial #6 - Act 6)

**5 of 6 Prisms obtained! Only Heaven Trial remains for Vandalier!**
