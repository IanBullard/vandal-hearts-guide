**Opening Strategy:**
1. **Diego:** Shoot War Ghosts (archers deal bonus damage to airmen)

**Priority Targets:**
1. **War Ghosts near your path** - Eliminate threats blocking route

3. **Avoid unnecessary fights** - Goal is church, not kills

**Optimal Route:**

- Let Diego handle War Ghosts blocking path
- Ash reaches church to trigger victory (don't need to kill all enemies)

**Difficulty:** Easy

|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:----------|
| **Clay Golem** (Armor) | 9 | 6 | 56 | 34/37/20 |

**Total Enemies:** 9 Golems

### Battle Strategy

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL BATTLE:** This is your first encounter with **Golems** (high DEF enemies). Physical attacks do minimal damage!

**The Golem Problem:**
- Golem Defense: 37 (very high)
- Sword attacks: ~8-12 damage (inefficient)
- **Eleni's magic:** ~25-35 damage (MUCH better)
- **This battle teaches you to use magic!**

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. **Eleni:** Use Dark Star on Golems (primary damage dealer)
2. **Huxley:** Heal Eleni, use staff attacks as backup
3. **Ash:** Use Ice Storm (magic bypasses DEF)
4. **Clint/Diego:** Physical attacks (chip damage only)

**Formation:**
```
[Clint] [Ash]
  [Eleni] [Huxley]
   [Diego]

Protect Eleni - she's MVP this battle
```

**Target Priority:**
- Kill Golems one at a time (focus fire)
- Eleni targets nearest Golem
- Physical units finish wounded Golems (<20 HP)

**MP Management:**
- Eleni starts with ~20-25 MP
- Dark Star costs 2 MP
- Can cast 10+ times per battle
- Don't waste MP on weak enemies

**Difficulty:** Moderate (First magic-required battle)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (8,1) | **Elixir** | South chest |
| (15,16) | **Herb** | NE chest |

**Hidden Items:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (14,0) | **Fire Gem** | SE corner, dirt hole |

**Total Gold:** 810G

### Post-Battle

**Lesson Learned:** Magic is essential vs high-DEF enemies
**Preparation:** Stock MP restoration items (Mage Oil)

| Hunter (Archer) | 2 | 5 | 37 | 23/18/22 |

**Total Enemies:** 12

{: .note }
> **Kira joins as reinforcement** after 2 rounds. She arrives on eastern side of map.

### Battle Strategy

**Key Challenge:** Large enemy force (12 enemies) with flying Hell Bats that can attack your back line.

**Phase 1 (Rounds 1-2):**
- **Defensive formation** - Don't overextend
- **Diego:** Shoot Hell Bats (bonus damage vs airmen)
- **Eleni:** Dark Star on enemy clusters
- **Ash/Clint:** Tank Brigand advances

- **Eleni:** Continue Dark Star on clusters
- **Front line:** Engage Brigands

**Priority Targets:**
1. **Hell Bats** - Flying threats to back line (kill with archers)
2. **Hunters** - Ranged attackers (moderate threat)
3. **Brigands** - Melee fodder (lowest priority)

**Positioning:**
```
[Clint] [Ash]
  [Eleni] [Huxley]
   [Diego] ... [Kira arrives E side]

Archers eliminate Hell Bats
Mages support with AOE
Knights hold front
```

**Difficulty:** Moderate (Numbers + flying enemies)

| Ant Arm (Minion) | 6 max | 1 | 13 | 9/8/11 | **Infinite spawning** |

{: .danger }
> **Ant Arms spawn infinitely!** Maximum 6 on field. Up to 4 spawn per round. They give **ZERO EXP/GOLD**. Focus Death Ant!

### Battle Strategy

**The Infinite Spawn Problem:**
- Ant Arms respawn every round (up to 4 per round)
- Killing them wastes turns
- They give no rewards
- **Ignore them, kill Death Ant only**

**Optimal Strategy:**
1. **ALL UNITS TARGET DEATH ANT**
2. Ignore Ant Arms (they're distractions)
3. Burst damage Death Ant before it spawns too many adds
4. Battle ends when Death Ant dies (Ant Arms disappear)

**Damage Priority:**
- **Eleni:** Dark Star on Death Ant (best damage)
- **Ash:** Ice Storm on Death Ant (magic damage)
- **Diego/Kira:** Shoot Death Ant (ranged safety)
- **Clint:** Melee Death Ant (if safe)
- **Huxley:** Heal, support

**Death Ant Stats:**
- 88 HP (high for Act 1)
- 55 DEF (very high - use magic!)
- Can self-heal (if it has spell)

**Target Damage:**
- Physical: ~10-15 damage
- Magic (Eleni): ~25-35 damage

|:------------|:-----|:---------|
