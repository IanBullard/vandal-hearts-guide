## Battle 2.0: Village of Yuzu

**Location:** Village of Yuzu
**Recommended Level:** 10
**Party:** Ash, Clint, Diego, Eleni, Huxley, Kira, Grog (7 characters)

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Destruction of all Evil Statues
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash **OR killing any Villagers**

{: .danger }
> **DO NOT KILL VILLAGERS!** There are 9 innocent villagers on the battlefield marked as "enemies." Killing them = instant defeat!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP/MP | AT/DF/AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:------|:----------|:-------|
| **Evil Statue** (Mage) | 7 | 5 | 33/12 | 15/12/28 | Piercing Light (3 MP) |
| **Villager** (Civilian) | 9 | 1 | 13 | 9/8/11 | None |

**Total Enemies:** 7 Evil Statues (+ 9 protected villagers)

### Battle Strategy

**The Villager Problem:**
- Villagers are coded as "enemies" but **must not be killed**
- They move randomly (no control)
- Attacking them = instant defeat
- Gold penalty if you kill them accidentally

**Safe Approach:**
1. **Identify Statues vs Villagers**
   - Evil Statues: Mage-class, can cast Piercing Light
   - Villagers: Monster-class, Level 1, no spells
   - **Check before attacking!**

2. **Ranged Attacks Preferred**
   - **Diego/Kira/Amon:** Shoot Statues from distance
   - Reduces risk of hitting villagers in AOE
   - Safer than melee (less repositioning)

3. **Avoid AOE Spells**
   - **Eleni:** DO NOT use Dark Star in crowded areas
   - Single-target spells only
   - Risk of hitting villagers too high

**Optimal Strategy:**
```
Formation:
Keep archers in back (Diego, Kira, Amon)
Identify all 7 Statues
Focus fire one at a time
Let villagers wander safely
```

**Evil Statue Stats:**
- Only 33 HP (very fragile)
- Low DEF (12) - physical attacks work
- Can cast Piercing Light (~20 damage)
- **2-3 hits to kill**

**Turn-by-Turn:**
1. **Round 1:** Archers shoot nearest Statue
2. **Round 2-4:** Continue focusing Statues one at a time
3. **Avoid villagers:** Let them wander, don't block their path
4. **Victory:** All 7 Statues destroyed, villagers alive

**Difficulty:** Easy (if careful about villagers)

## Battle 2.1: Ygdra Canyon

**Location:** Ygdra Canyon
**Recommended Level:** 10
**Party:** Ash, Clint, Diego, Eleni, Huxley, Kira, Grog + **Dolan, Amon, Sara** (10 characters!)

{: .note }
> **Three new characters join!** Dolan (Soldier Lv.10), Amon (Archer Lv.9), Sara (Healer Lv.9)

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Destruction of all enemies
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash or Dolan

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT/DF/AGL |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:----------|
| Madsoldier (Knight) | 10 | 8 | 63 | 38/33/33 |
| Guarddog (Monster) | 5 | 6 | 45 | 24/22/30 |

**Total Enemies:** 15

### Battle Strategy

**The Numbers Game:**
- 15 enemies vs your 10 characters
- Large battlefield (24×18 grid)
- Canyon terrain (chokepoints available)

**New Characters Assessment:**
- **Dolan:** Soldier Lv.10 (good front-line tank)
- **Amon:** Archer Lv.9 (third archer! great addition)
- **Sara:** Healer Lv.9 (second healer! excellent support)

**Optimal Formation:**
```
Front Line: Clint, Grog, Dolan, Ash (4 tanks)
Mid Line: Eleni, Huxley, Sara (mages/healers)
Back Line: Diego, Kira, Amon (3 archers)

Strong defensive setup
Two healers = great sustainability
Three archers = heavy ranged damage
```

**Strategy:**
1. **Use canyon chokepoints** - Force enemies through narrow gaps
2. **Two-healer advantage** - Huxley + Sara keep party healthy
3. **Three-archer firepower** - Focus fire priority targets
4. **Eleni's Dark Star** - AOE on clustered enemies

**Priority Targets:**
- Guarddogs first (faster, more dangerous)
- Madsoldiers second (slower, less threatening)

**Difficulty:** Moderate (numbers, but you have 10 characters)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (22,2) | **Moodring** | SE corner |
| (22,16) | **Elixir** | NE corner |

**Hidden Items:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (1,0) | **Mad Book** | SW corner, dirt crater |
| (1,17) | **MACROMAN** | **NW corner, dirt hole** |

{: .danger }
> **MACROMAN IS CRITICAL!** This is 1 of 3 Collector's Treasures needed for Chaos Key (Trial #4). You **MUST** collect this!

**Total Gold:** 3,150G

### Post-Battle

**Critical:** Verify you collected **MACROMAN**
**Next Collector's Items:** TAROT (Act 3), RAMEN (Act 4)
**Story:** Continue Gillbaris investigation with full 10-character party

## Battle 2.2: Loris Beach

**Location:** Loris Beach
**Recommended Level:** 11
**Party:** All 10 characters (Ash, Clint, Diego, Eleni, Huxley, Kira, Grog, Dolan, Amon, Sara)

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Destruction of all enemies
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT/DF/AGL |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:----------|
| Madsoldier (Knight) | 6 | 9 | 70 | 42/36/36 |
| Shooterimp (Archer) | 3 | 9 | 63 | 36/29/34 |
| **Dark Golem** (Armor) | 3 | 9 | 80 | 47/51/27 |
| **Bloodghost** (Airman) | 3 | 9 | 75 | 51/40/38 |

**Total Enemies:** 15

### Battle Strategy

**Mixed Enemy Composition:**
- Golems (high DEF, need magic)
- Bloodghosts (flying, dangerous to back-line)
- Shooterips (ranged threats)
- Madsoldiers (melee fodder)

**Priority Targets:**
1. **Bloodghosts FIRST** - Flying airmen threaten mages/healers
   - Use Diego/Kira/Amon (archers deal bonus damage to airmen)
   - Focus fire to eliminate quickly

2. **Shooterips SECOND** - Ranged attackers
   - Archer vs archer battles
   - Remove before they damage your low-DEF units

3. **Dark Golems** - Use Eleni's magic
   - Physical attacks do ~10 damage (useless)
   - Dark Star does ~30 damage (effective)

4. **Madsoldiers LAST** - Standard melee cleanup

**Optimal Approach:**
```
Round 1-3: All archers focus Bloodghosts
Round 4-6: Eleni Dark Stars Golems, archers shoot Shooterips
Round 7+: Clean up Madsoldiers
```

**Formation:**
- Dual healers (Huxley + Sara) keep party healthy
- Triple archers eliminate flying threats
- Eleni handles Golems (MVP this battle)

**Difficulty:** Moderate to High (diverse enemy types)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:** None

**Hidden Items:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (8,1) | **BANANA** | **South edge, middle of cross-shaped swamp** |

{: .danger }
> **BANANA IS CRITICAL!** Trade this to Young Man at Yuzu Tavern for **KEY OF EARTH** (Trial #2). Don't miss it!

**Total Gold:** 3,600G

### Post-Battle

**IMMEDIATELY:** Go to Yuzu Village Tavern
- Talk to **Young Man**
- Trade **BANANA** → receive **KEY OF EARTH**
- Unlocks Earth Trial (can attempt now or later)

**Earth Trial Note:** All enemies are Archers
- Ground archers (Snipers) recommended
- Flying units (Hawknights) take bonus damage = very dangerous
- Plan accordingly

---

## Optional: Earth Trial

**Location:** Special battle arena (access via any Dojo with Earth Key)
**Recommended Level:** 11-13
**Available Party:** All 10 characters

{: .warning }
> **ALL ENEMIES ARE ARCHERS!** This Trial features 16 archer-class enemies. Flying units (Hawknights/Sky Lords) are **extremely vulnerable** (take bonus damage)!

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Defeat all enemies + **collect Earth Prism from chest**
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash

{: .danger }
> **MUST COLLECT PRISM!** Defeating enemies without getting chest = cannot retry Trial!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Notes |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Hunter (Archer) | 3 | Scales with Ash level |
| Hunterimp (Archer) | 3 | Scales with Ash level |
| Corsair (Archer) | 3 | Scales with Ash level |
| Shooterimp (Archer) | 3 | Scales with Ash level |
| Grenadier (Archer) | 2 | Scales with Ash level |
| C.Archer (Archer) | 2 | Scales with Ash level |

**Total Enemies:** 16 Archers

### Battle Strategy

{: .important }
> **Archer vs Archer battle!** This is unique - only ranged enemies.

**Critical:** **DO NOT bring Hawknights/Sky Lords!**
- Flying units take **bonus damage** from archers
- Will die in 2-3 hits
- Bring **ground Snipers only**

**Recommended Party:**
- **Archers:** Diego, Kira, Amon (all ground-based)
- **Mages:** Eleni (Dark Star from range)
- **Healers:** Huxley, Sara (keep archers healthy)
- **Knights:** Ash, Clint, Grog, Dolan (tanks, but less useful)
- **AVOID:** Any flying units

**Strategy:**
1. **Archer duel** - Your archers vs their archers
2. **Focus fire** - All 3 archers shoot same target (quick kills)
3. **Eleni supports** - Dark Star on clustered enemies
4. **Healers sustain** - Both healers keep archers alive
5. **Knights advance** - Slow but steady front-line pressure

**Key Tactics:**
- **Elevation advantage** - Seek high ground (range bonus)
- **Kiting** - Shoot and retreat (stay at max range)
- **Focus fire** - 3 archers = 1 enemy dead per round
- **Heal preemptively** - Don't let archers drop below 50% HP

**Difficulty:** Moderate (if ground archers), Very Hard (if flying units)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:**

| Coordinates | Item | CRITICAL |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (12,7) | **Earth Prism** | **MUST COLLECT!** |

{: .note }

**Location:** Castle Ruins - Exterior
**Recommended Level:** 12
**Party:** All 10 characters

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Arrival at Entrance (north side)

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT/DF/AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:----------|:-------|
| Madsoldier (Knight) | 6 | 11 | 84 | 49/43/43 | None |

| Evil Statue (Mage) | 2 | 11 | 66/12 | 28/23/52 | Piercing Light |

**Total Enemies:** 17

### Battle Strategy

**Large Map Challenge:**
- Huge battlefield (32×16 grid)
- Goal: Reach entrance (north), not kill all enemies
- Can avoid unnecessary fights

**Priority Approach:**
1. **Identify path to entrance** (northern edge)
2. **Clear blocking enemies only**
3. **Avoid side detours** (wastes turns)
4. **Reach entrance ASAP**

**Enemy Priorities (if fighting):**
1. **Bloodghosts** - Flying threats (archers eliminate)
2. **Evil Statues** - Mages with spells (archers snipe)
3. **Shooterips** - Ranged enemies (remove first)
4. **Dark Golems** - Magic required (Eleni handles)
5. **Madsoldiers** - Melee fodder (avoid if possible)

**Speed Run Strategy:**
- Send **fast units** (Airmen if you have them) toward entrance
- **Main party** clears path
- **Ash reaches entrance** = victory (doesn't need whole party)

**Standard Strategy:**
- Advance as group (safer)
- Clear enemies blocking route
- Ignore enemies on flanks
- Victory when entrance reached

**Difficulty:** Moderate (large map, many enemies, but can skip most)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (15,1) | **Mage Oil** | South side |
| (15,14) | **Moodring** | North side (near entrance) |

|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (7,7) | **Ironboot** | Western edge, archer guard area |
| (23,15) | **Chain Mail** | NE corner, main island, X marks spot |

**Total Gold:** 4,590G

### Post-Battle

**Story:** Enter Castle Ruins interior for boss confrontation
**Preparation:** Stock healing items, full MP for next battle (Magnus boss fight)

---

## Battle 2.4: Castle Ruins (Inside) - Boss Battle

**Location:** Castle Ruins - Interior
**Recommended Level:** 13
**Party:** All 10 characters

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Defeat Magnus Dark Lord (boss)
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash

{: .danger }
> **MAJOR BOSS BATTLE:** Magnus Dark Lord can self-heal and has powerful AOE attack (Rainbow Storm)!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP/MP | AT/DF/AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:------|:----------|:-------|
| **Magnus Dark Lord** (Boss) | 1 | 15 | 128/18 | 73/79/42 | Self Healing (2 MP), Rainbow Storm (7 MP, R:4/F:2) |
| Madsoldier (Knight) | 4 | 12 | 91 | 53/46/46 | None |
| Shooterimp (Archer) | 3 | 11 | 75 | 43/34/41 | None |
| Dark Golem (Armor) | 2 | 12 | 104 | 60/65/35 | None |
| Bloodghost (Airman) | 3 | 12 | 97 | 65/51/49 | None |

**Total Enemies:** 13 (1 boss + 12 adds)

### Battle Strategy

**Magnus's Abilities:**
- **Self Healing** (2 MP) - Restores ~30-40 HP
- **Rainbow Storm** (7 MP, R:4/F:2) - AOE attack, 40-60 damage to 3×3 area
- **Very High Stats** - 128 HP, 79 DEF, 73 ATK
- **Armor class** - Weak to magic, strong vs physical

**Two-Phase Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Clear Supporting Enemies (Rounds 1-5)**
1. **Bloodghosts first** - Archers eliminate (flying threats)
2. **Shooterips second** - Remove ranged attackers
3. **Dark Golems** - Eleni's magic (high DEF)
4. **Madsoldiers last** - Standard melee cleanup

**Rationale:** Reduce total damage output before Magnus fight

**Phase 2: Focus Magnus (Rounds 6-10+)**
1. **Eleni:** Dark Star on Magnus (magic bypasses 79 DEF!)
   - Physical: ~10-15 damage (terrible)
   - Magic: ~35-50 damage (effective)

2. **All damage dealers:** Focus fire Magnus
   - Archers shoot (moderate damage)
   - Ash uses Ice Storm (magic)
   - Physical as backup

3. **Healers:** Keep party above 75% HP
   - Magnus can Rainbow Storm (40-60 AOE damage)
   - Huxley + Sara = dual healing (redundancy)

4. **Kill before multiple heals:**
   - Magnus has 18 MP
   - Self Healing costs 2 MP
   - Can heal 9 times (!)
   - **Burst damage to prevent heal-spam**

**Positioning:**
```
Spread out formation (avoid Rainbow Storm hitting multiple)

[Clint]    [Grog]    [Dolan]
   [Eleni] [Huxley] [Sara]
[Diego]    [Kira]    [Amon]

Don't cluster in 3×3 areas!
```

**Magnus Kill Plan:**
- 128 HP total
- Eleni does ~40 damage per Dark Star
- 3-4 Dark Stars + support = Magnus down
- **Focus fire, don't let him heal**

**Difficulty:** Hard (Boss with healing + AOE)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:** None

**Hidden Items:** None

**Total Gold:** 4,200G

### Post-Battle

{: .important }
> **STORY EVENT:** Time warp occurs! Ash, Sara, Magnus, and Grog are sucked into temporal rift. **Skip 3 years into future!**

**Party Split:**
- **Missing:** Ash, Sara, Grog, Magnus (time warp)
- **Remaining:** Clint, Diego, Eleni, Huxley, Kira, Dolan, Amon

**Next Battle:** Escape with reduced 7-character party

---

## Battle 2.5: Castle Ruins (Outside 2) - Timed Escape

**Location:** Castle Ruins - Exterior (different area)
**Recommended Level:** 14
**Party:** Clint, Diego, Grog, Dolan, Amon (Sara missing)

{: .danger }
> **TIMED BATTLE:** Must complete in **6 TURNS** or lose! Reduced party (no Ash, Eleni, Huxley, Kira, Sara)!

### Objectives

- **Victory:** Conquest within 6 turns
- **Defeat:** Death of Ash **OR** Time runs out

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT/DF/AGL |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:----------|
| Guarddog (Monster) | 12 | 1 | 13 | 9/8/11 |

**Total Enemies:** 12 weak Guarddogs

### Battle Strategy

**The Challenge:**
- **WEAK enemies** (Level 1, only 13 HP each)
- **TIGHT timer** (6 turns only!)
- **Reduced party** (7 characters, missing best units)

**Missing Key Units:**
- No Ash (Hero)
- No Eleni (Mage - no AOE!)
- No Huxley (Healer - no healing!)
- No Kira (Archer)
- No Sara (Healer)

**Available Units:**
- **Clint** (Knight)
- **Diego** (Archer)
- **Grog** (Knight)
- **Dolan** (Knight)
- **Amon** (Archer)
- **+ 2 more from story**

**Speed Strategy:**
1. **Split party** - Don't move as group (too slow)
2. **Each character kills 2 Guarddogs** (12 enemies / 6 turns)
3. **One-hit kills** - Guarddogs only have 13 HP
4. **Maximize movement** - Use full move + attack each turn

**Turn-by-Turn Plan:**
```
Turn 1: Move forward, attack 1-2 dogs each
Turn 2: Continue advancing, kill more
Turn 3: Spread out, each unit targets nearest
Turn 4: Clean up stragglers
Turn 5: Final kills
Turn 6: (Should be done by Turn 5!)
```

**Key Tactics:**
- **One-shot potential:** Every character can kill Guarddog in 1 hit
- **Don't cluster:** Spread out to cover more ground
- **Ignore defense:** No healing available, just attack aggressively
- **Speed over safety:** 6 turns is very tight

**Difficulty:** Moderate (easy enemies, tight timer, no healing)

### Treasure & Items

**Treasure Chests:** None

**Hidden Items:**

| Coordinates | Item | Location |
|:------------|:-----|:---------|
| (19,0) | **Mage Gem** | SE corner, dirt hole |
