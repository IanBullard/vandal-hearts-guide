## Act Overview

**Standard Level Range:** 14-17
**Total Battles:** 7 (6 story + optional Mana Trial)
**Recommended Party Size:** 3-12 (starts reduced, gradually reunites)
**Total Gold Available:** ~36,980 G (excluding variable Tower Defense)

{: .important }
> **Major Story Event:** You've traveled **3 years into the future!** The world has changed dramatically during your absence.

### Story Context

After the space-time rift incident at the end of Act 2, Ash and a few companions find themselves in a strange land. They soon discover that they've been transported **3 years into the future**. In their absence:

- **Emperor Hel Spites** has seized total control of Ishtaria
- Papers claim **Ash assassinated Magnus** (framed!)
- The Council has been disbanded
- Ronaldo Castille (the good ruler) was thrown out of power
- Imperial Government established with Hel as dictator
- Your party was separated by the time warp

This Act focuses on:
1. **Reuniting the scattered party** across the changed timeline
2. **Rescuing imprisoned allies** (Clint, Eleni, Amon)
3. **Finding the truth** about what happened in 3 years
4. **Obtaining critical items:** TAROT (Chaos Key component) and MANA KEY (Trial #3)

### New Characters This Act

| Character | Class | Join Battle | Level |
|:----------|:------|:------------|:------|
| **Zohar Abu Sa'id** | Mage | 3.1 | 14 |
| **Darius** | Archer | After 3.4 | 14 |

{: .note }
> **Zohar** is an ancient mage who helps navigate the changed world. **Darius** is rescued from prison alongside Clint.

### Critical Items This Act

| Item | Battle | Purpose |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| **TAROT** | 3.3 (Basil Gate) | Collector's Treasure #2 for Chaos Key |
| **MANA KEY** | 3.6 (Prison Fortress II) | Direct key for Trial #3 (Mana) |
| **Zen Robe** | 3.6 (Boss Drop) | Unique armor from Dumas |

{: .danger }
> **Missable Items:** Both TAROT and MANA KEY are **only available once** in their respective battles. Do not finish these battles without collecting them!

---

## Battle 3.0: Plain of Sorrow

**Recommended Level:** 14
**Map Size:** 16×17 grid
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .warning }
> **Reduced Party:** Only **3 characters available** - Ash, Grog, and Sara! Everyone else was lost in the time warp.

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| Sparkie (Ai) | 5 | 8 | 67 | 46 | 36 | 35 | None |

**Total Gold:** 1,850 G

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Very Easy - Introductory battle

This is the easiest battle in Act 3, serving mainly as story setup. Despite having only 3 characters, the enemies are significantly weaker than your party.

**Enemy Analysis:**
- **Sparkies** are flying disembodied head enemies
- Extremely weak at any level
- Often one-shot killed by strong characters
- Flying movement but poor stats

**Recommended Approach:**

**Turn 1 - Defensive Positioning:**
1. **Hold your ground** - don't advance
2. Stay in tight formation against starting wall
3. Let Sparkies approach you
4. Conserve MP and items for upcoming battles

**Turns 2+ - Counterattack:**
1. Sparkies will approach and attack
2. **Counterattack them to death** as they engage
3. Clean up any stragglers
4. Battle ends quickly with minimal effort

{: .note }
> This is one of the rare battles where doing nothing initially is the optimal strategy. The Sparkies are so weak that counterattacks alone can handle most of them.

### Party Recommendations

**Ash (Hero/Champion):**
- Main damage dealer
- Position centrally to attract multiple attackers
- Save any Hero spells for harder battles ahead

**Grog (Knight):**
- Frontline fighter
- High HP makes him ideal for absorbing attacks
- Physical attacks sufficient for these weak enemies

**Sara (Priest/Bishop):**
- Support and backup
- Conserve MP - no healing likely needed
- Can contribute physical attacks safely

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items:** None

**Notable Drops:** None

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**
- Magnus dies, telling Ash to pursue Hel and the Magic Stone
- Meet **Zohar Abu Sa'id**, an enigmatic figure
- Visit **Remote City** for shops and information
- Visit tavern to learn about the changed world
- Visit Zohar's house for backstory
- **Zohar joins the party** as a Mage

**Town Services Available:**
- **Shop:** Standard equipment and items
- **Dojo:** Class advancement (if characters are Level 10+)
- **Tavern:** Information about world events

{: .important }
> **Advance Zohar's Class!** If Zohar is Level 10 or higher when he joins, visit the Dojo immediately to advance him to Sorceror. This gives him access to **Phase Shift**, one of the most powerful spells in the game - critical for the next battle!

**Shopping Recommendations:**
- Buy at least one **Herb** for Zohar
- His default equipment is already optimal
- Stock up on healing items if low
- Save gold for post-reunion shopping

**Before Leaving Town:**
- Check all characters' equipment
- Ensure Zohar has Herb/Megaherb
- When ready, return to the Plain of Sorrow (where you arrived)
- Next battle begins immediately upon arrival - no time to prepare!

---

## Battle 3.1: Plain of Sorrow II - Tower Defense

**Recommended Level:** 15
**Map Size:** 16×17 grid (same as 3.0)
**Victory Condition:** Survive 5 turns with at least one tower intact
**Defeat Condition:** All 4 Mage Towers destroyed OR Death of Ash

{: .danger }
> **Special Battle Type:** Tower Defense! You must protect magical towers from infinite enemy spawns for 5 turns.

{: .warning }
> **Only 4 Characters Available:** Ash, Grog, Sara, Zohar. This battle **forces Ash participation** - problematic if you're keeping him low-level for Trials!

### Objectives to Protect

| Structure | Count | HP | DF | AGL | Notes |
|:----------|:------|:---|:---|:----|:------|
| Mage Tower | 4 | 14 | 5 | 0 | Must protect at least ONE! |

{: .important }
> **Victory Condition:** At least **1 tower** must survive until Turn 6. You don't need to save all four - just one!

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | # | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Notes |
|:-----------|:--|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:------|
| Sparkie (Initial) | 6 | 8 | 67 | 46 | 36 | 35 | Starting wave |
| Sparkie (Spawns) | ∞ | 10 | 82 | 55 | 43 | 42 | Replacements |

**Spawn Mechanics:**
- **Infinite spawning** - Sparkies appear endlessly
- Maximum 6 on field at once
- Up to +4 can spawn per turn
- Spawn from corner positions
- Replace fallen Sparkies continuously

**Total Gold:** 410 G per Sparkie killed, -100 G per Tower destroyed

{: .note }
> Players typically kill 11-21 Sparkies depending on strategy. Can farm gold/EXP by killing many, or play defensively and kill fewer.

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Medium - "Kinda hard, and kinda easy"

This unique battle requires a different mindset than standard combat. You're not trying to eliminate all enemies (impossible - they're infinite!). You're trying to **survive 5 turns** with minimal casualties.

**Strategic Decision: Two Main Approaches**

The battle offers two distinct strategies with different risk/reward profiles:

#### Strategy 1: Defend All Towers (Difficult, High Reward)

**Setup:**
- Assign one character per tower (4 towers, 4 characters)
- Each character guards their tower solo
- Maximum exposure to damage

**Advantages:**
- All towers survive = no gold penalty
- +1,600 G bonus (4 towers × 400 G)
- More kills = more EXP and gold
- Typical kills: 15-21 Sparkies = 6,150-8,610 G

**Disadvantages:**
- Spread thin - characters isolated
- Heavy damage taken
- Risk of character death
- Requires good equipment and levels
- Healing item consumption high

**Execution:**
1. Position one character adjacent to each tower
2. Absorb attacks meant for tower
3. Kill Sparkies as they spawn near your tower
4. Heal frequently (Megaherbs recommended)
5. Hold position until Turn 6

{: .warning }
> This strategy requires characters to tank significant damage. Not recommended if undergeared or low on healing items!

#### Strategy 2: Defend One Tower (Easy, Conservative)

**Setup:**
- Pick ONE tower to defend (corner tower recommended)
- **Surround it with all 4 characters** in tight formation
- Abandon other 3 towers

**Advantages:**
- Much easier to survive
- Concentrated healing
- Mutual support and protection
- Guaranteed victory (4 characters protecting 1 tower)
- Lower healing item consumption

**Disadvantages:**
- Lose 3 towers = -300 G penalty
- -1,200 G missed tower bonus
- Fewer Sparkies killed = less total gold/EXP
- Typical kills: 6-11 Sparkies = ~2,460-4,510 G

**Execution:**
1. **Choose your tower** (corner tower often easiest)
2. Move all 4 characters to **surround** the chosen tower
3. Form tight defensive square
4. Kill any Sparkie that approaches
5. Heal your tower if damaged (Sara's healing spells work on towers!)
6. Hold until Turn 6

{: .note }
> **Author Recommendation:** Most FAQ authors recommend this approach for first-time players. "Don't thin your forces and lose" - focus on guaranteed success over maximum rewards.

#### Hybrid Strategy (Recommended for Experienced Players)

**Setup:**
- Defend 2 adjacent towers with pairs of characters
- More balanced risk/reward

**Advantages:**
- 2 towers survive = -200 G penalty vs -300 G
- +800 G bonus for 2 towers
- More kills than 1-tower strategy
- More manageable than 4-tower spread
- Typical kills: 11-15 Sparkies = ~4,510-6,150 G

**Execution:**
1. Choose 2 adjacent towers (easier mutual support)
2. Assign 2 characters per tower
3. Characters can assist each other
4. More sustainable than full spread

### Turn-by-Turn Tactical Guide

**Pre-Battle:**
- Ensure all characters have healing items (Herb/Megaherb)
- Check MP levels (Sara should be near full)
- Zohar should have Phase Shift if Sorceror

**Turn 1 - Initial Positioning:**
1. **Move to chosen tower(s)** immediately
2. If defending all 4: spread characters (1 per tower)
3. If defending 1: cluster all 4 around chosen tower
4. Don't attack yet - let them come to you

**Turn 2 - First Contact:**
1. Sparkies begin approaching towers
2. **Zohar:** Use **Phase Shift** to hit multiple Sparkies (if available)
   - Range 3-7, Field 1
   - Can hit 2-3 Sparkies at once
   - ~50+ damage to each = OHKO on Level 8, heavy damage to Level 10
3. Other characters: Physical attacks on nearest threats
4. **Priority:** Sparkies actively attacking towers > Sparkies approaching

**Turn 3 - Spawn Management:**
1. More Sparkies spawn (up to 6 total on field)
2. **Kill Sparkies threatening your defended tower(s) first**
3. Ignore Sparkies heading to abandoned towers (if using 1-tower strategy)
4. Sara: Heal tower if damaged (Healing spell works on towers!)
5. Conserve character HP for later turns

**Turn 4 - Attrition Phase:**
1. Sparkies continue spawning
2. Damage accumulates on characters
3. **Sara:** Begin healing characters (not just towers)
4. Grog/Ash: Continue killing nearest threats
5. Zohar: Phase Shift when 2+ targets available, else conserve MP

**Turn 5 - Final Defense:**
1. Last turn before victory
2. **Healing priority:** Keep tower(s) alive!
   - Tower HP: 14 total
   - Sparkies deal ~15-25 damage
   - If tower below 25 HP, heal it!
2. Kill any Sparkies in attack range of defended tower(s)
3. Don't overextend - victory arrives next turn

**Turn 6 - Victory:**
- Warp activates automatically
- Battle ends regardless of enemy count
- Rewards calculated (kills + tower bonuses - tower penalties)

### Spell Usage Recommendations

**Zohar (Mage/Sorceror):**
- **Phase Shift** (if Sorceror): Your MVP spell
  - Range 3-7, Field 1 = hits area
  - ~50+ damage to multiple targets
  - Can kill 2-3 Sparkies per cast
  - Use when 2+ Sparkies are grouped
  - Author quote: "Phase Shift is king here... large-scale genocide"
- **Roman Fire** (if Sorceror): Backup AOE
  - Shorter range than Phase Shift
  - Equal damage but less coverage
  - Use if Phase Shift out of range
- **Piercing Light** (if Mage): Single-target damage
  - Save MP for Phase Shift advancement

**Sara (Priest/Bishop):**
- **Healing:** Can target towers AND characters!
  - Range 1-5 = can reach towers from distance
  - ~20-30 HP restored
  - Critical for keeping tower(s) alive
- **Supreme Healing** (if Archbishop): Massive healing
  - Infinite range, heals party
  - Overkill for this battle (conserve MP for later)
- **Physical Attacks:** Contribute to Sparkie kills when healing not needed

### Gold & Experience Optimization

**Maximum Gold Strategy:**
- Defend all 4 towers successfully
- Kill as many Sparkies as possible
- Best case: 21 Sparkies + 4 towers = ~10,210 G
- Requires: Strong party, good equipment, Megaherbs

**Balanced Strategy:**
- Defend 2 towers
- Kill 11-15 Sparkies
- Realistic: ~4,510-6,150 G
- Good balance of safety and rewards

**Safe Strategy:**
- Defend 1 tower
- Kill 6-11 Sparkies
- Minimum: ~2,160 G (after penalties)
- Guaranteed success, lowest stress

**Experience Farming:**
- Each Sparkie defeated = 150-200 EXP per character
- 15-21 Sparkies = ~2,250-3,150 EXP per character
- Great opportunity to advance classes before next shop!
- Good for getting Zohar to Sorceror if still Mage

{: .note }
> **Ash Leveling Warning:** If keeping Ash low-level for Trials, this battle is problematic. Only 4 characters available = Ash **must** participate. Expect him to reach Level 15+ even with minimal actions.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Spreading Too Thin:**
- "Don't split forces" - trying to defend all towers without preparation
- Results in isolated characters being overwhelmed
- Character death = game over

**❌ Aggressive Sparkie Hunting:**
- Chasing kills instead of defending
- Leaving towers exposed
- Missing priority targets

**❌ Poor MP Management:**
- Wasting Phase Shift on single targets
- Running Zohar out of MP early
- Sara using healing spells when not needed

**❌ Forgetting Towers Can Be Healed:**
- Many players don't realize Sara can heal towers!
- Healing spell works on towers just like characters
- Can save a tower from destruction

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Pick defense strategy and stick to it
- Prioritize tower survival over kills
- Use AOE magic efficiently
- Heal towers when needed
- Survive to Turn 6 = victory

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items:** None

**Notable Drops:** None

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**
- Party enters the warp portal
- Return to present time (end of time displacement)
- Scene changes - can now see a town
- **Major revelation:** The "present time" is actually 3 years in the future!
- Old companions appear: **Diego, Dolan, Amon, Sara** (wait, Sara was with you? This is their future selves)
- **First partial reunion** - learning about 3-year gap

{: .important }
> **Immediate Next Battle:** The reunion battle at Terasu Village begins right after this scene. No shopping or preparation time!

**Party Status:**
- Keep current party (Ash, Grog, Sara, Zohar)
- Next battle will have MORE characters (reunion!)
- Check HP/MP levels
- Consume items if needed before automatic transition

---

## Battle 3.2: Terasu Village - Reunion

**Recommended Level:** 15
**Map Size:** 24×18 grid (large map!)
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash

{: .note }
> **Party Reunion!** Many separated allies rejoin the party for this battle, though some are still missing (Clint, Eleni, Amon).

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| **Zoot Thief Lord** (Boss) | 1 | 17 | 126 | 72 | 63 | 63 | SELF HEALING R2 |
| Centurion (Kn) | 5 | 12 | 91 | 53 | 46 | 46 | None |
| Grenadier (Bo) | 3 | 11 | 75 | 43 | 34 | 41 | None |

| Deacon (Pr) | 1 | 14 | 75 | 40 | 32 | 65 | HEALING R3 |

**Total Gold:** 6,750 G

{: .note }
> **Boss Return:** Zoot Gach is back from Act 1 Battle 1.1! He's been promoted to **Thief Lord** and is much more dangerous.

### Party Available

**Player-Controlled:**
- Ash, Grog, Sara, Zohar (time-warped group)
- Diego, Huxley, Dolan (rejoining allies)
- **7 characters total** under your control

**NPC Ally:**
- **Clive** (Level 15, CPU-controlled)
- Fights alongside you but AI-controlled
- Cannot command directly
- Will interfere with treasure collection if not managed!

{: .warning }
> **Clive Alert:** Clive is aggressive and will kill enemies without regard for your treasure collecting plans. Don't let him kill the last enemy before securing all chests/secrets!

### New Enemy Types

**Centurion (Knight class):**
- Upgraded Swordsman

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (2):**

| Location | Coordinates | Item | Value/Use |
|:---------|:------------|:-----|:----------|
| SW area | (6,1) | ELIXIR | Restores all HP/MP |
| NE area | (22,17) | MEGAHERB | Restores ~100 HP |

**Hidden Items (2):**

| (0,7) | UNICORN | W edge, crater marking | ~1,500 G (sell) |
| (13,16) | GOLDCOIN | N edge, dirt hole | 1,000 G (sell) |

**Total Treasure Value:** 1 Elixir + 1 Megaherb + ~2,500 G in sellables

{: .important }
> **UNICORN Secret:** Located in crater south of Ash's starting position. Have Zohar grab it Turn 1 by moving 1 space south.

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Hard - "Much harder than it looks"

Multiple FAQ authors warn this battle is deceptively difficult. The enemies use gang-up tactics and can isolate/kill characters if you're not careful.

**Battlefield Layout:**
- Large village map with houses and obstacles
- **Bridge** divides Ash's party from Diego's party
- **Boulder** can be pushed for damage
- Two fronts of combat initially

**Starting Positions:**
- **Ash's Party (West):** Ash, Grog, Sara, Zohar near bridge
- **Diego's Party (East):** Diego, Huxley, Dolan near upper houses
- **Clive (NPC):** Near Diego's party, CPU-controlled
- **Enemies:** Spread throughout village, Zoot on high ground in NE

### Phase-by-Phase Strategy

#### Phase 1: Defensive Opening (Turns 1-2)

{: .danger }
> **Critical Warning:** "DO NOT move Ash's party immediately!" - Multiple FAQ authors emphasize this.

**Ash's Party (West Bridge):**

**Turn 1 Actions:**
1. **Zohar:** Move 1 space **south** to grab UNICORN secret at (0,7)
2. **Ash:** HOLD POSITION against wall (don't cross bridge!)
3. **Grog:** HOLD POSITION against wall
4. **Sara:** HOLD POSITION behind Ash/Grog

**Defensive Stance Reasoning:**
- Enemies use gang-up AI - they swarm isolated targets
- Moving forward exposes you to 5-6 enemies at once
- Tight formation prevents flanking
- Wall behind you = no rear attacks possible
- Forces enemies to approach into YOUR counterattacks

**Turn 2 Actions:**
1. Centurions will approach bridge toward Ash
2. **Maintain defensive wall** - don't break formation yet
3. **Zohar:** Support with **Phase Shift** if Sorceror (don't get in front line!)
   - Can hit 2-3 enemies at once if grouped
   - ~50+ damage to Centurions/Grenadiers
4. **Counterattacks** should soften/kill approaching enemies

{: .warning }
> **Gang-Up AI:** "The enemies in this one like to gang up and kill each of your guys" - stay together!

**Diego's Party (East):**

**Turn 1 Actions:**
1. **Diego:** If Bowman/Hawknight = move toward Blood Bat (priority!)
   - Blood Bats inflict paralysis = top priority
   - Ranged attack from safe distance
2. **Dolan:** Stand in front of **boulder**
   - Don't push it yet! "Wait a turn or two"
   - Position for future push
3. **Huxley:** Support position behind Diego
4. **Clive (NPC):** Will act on his own (ignore)

**Turn 2 Actions:**
1. **Diego:** Shoot Blood Bat (eliminate paralysis threat)
2. **Dolan:** WAIT - don't push boulder yet
3. **Huxley:** Support combat or healing as needed
4. Begin moving toward chests if safe

#### Phase 2: Boulder Push & Bridge Assault (Turns 3-4)

**Dolan's Boulder:**

**Turn 3 - Push Boulder:**
1. Dolan pushes boulder down hill
2. Boulder **rolls through enemy masses**
3. Hits multiple enemies for significant damage
4. ~30-50 damage per enemy hit
5. Halves HP of Centurions/Grenadiers

**Ash's Bridge Assault:**

**Turn 3-4 - Advance:**
1. Bridge enemies should be thinned by counterattacks/magic
2. **Slowly advance** Ash's party over bridge
3. Maintain formation - don't let characters get isolated
4. Priority targets:
   - **Blood Bats** (Diego or ranged magic)
   - **Warlock** (dangerous AOE)
   - Grenadiers (ranged attackers)
   - Centurions (cleanup)

**Zohar's Magic:**
1. **Phase Shift** when 3+ enemies grouped in open space
   - Large field spell = can hit many
   - ~50+ damage to Grenadiers/Centurions
   - One-shot kills if they took boulder damage
2. **Roman Fire** for tighter groups
3. Conserve some MP for later battles

#### Phase 3: Treasure Collection & Enemy Management (Turns 5-7)

{: .important }
> **Treasure Timing:** Kill all enemies **except one** (preferably Deacon or Grenadier) to safely collect chests and secrets.

**Treasure Collection Order:**

**Priority 1 - UNICORN (already collected):**
- Zohar grabbed it Turn 1 ✓

**Priority 2 - SW Chest (ELIXIR):**
1. Send fighter from Ash's party
2. Move toward SW corner (6,1)
3. Open chest → ELIXIR

**Priority 3 - NE Chest (MEGAHERB):**
1. **Clint** (from Diego's party) moves toward NE (22,17)
2. Open chest → MEGAHERB

**Priority 4 - GOLDCOIN Secret:**
1. After opening NE chest, Clint moves to (13,16)
2. Dirt hole on N edge of hill where Zoot was standing
3. Search → GOLDCOIN

**Enemy to Leave Alive:**
- **Deacon** (preferred) - least threatening
  - Low damage
  - Healing spell doesn't help if alone
  - Easy to keep track of
- **Grenadier** (alternative) - rarely counterattacks
  - Authors mention "easier with grenadier alive" for secret hunting

{: .warning }
> **Protect Last Enemy from Clive!** The NPC will try to kill everyone. Position your party to block Clive from reaching the last enemy until all treasures are collected.

**Execution:**
1. Kill all Blood Bats first (paralysis danger)
2. Kill Warlock (damage threat)
3. Kill Zoot (self-healing is annoying)
4. Kill Centurions (4 of 5)
5. Kill Grenadiers (2 of 3)
6. **Leave 1 Deacon OR 1 Grenadier alive**
7. Collect all 4 treasures (2 chests + 2 secrets)
8. **Then** kill last enemy

#### Phase 4: Zoot Boss Fight

**Boss: Zoot Thief Lord**
- Level 17, 126 HP
- SELF HEALING R2 (can heal ~30 HP)
- High AT (72), high DF (63), high AGL (63)
- More dangerous than his Act 1 version

**Strategy:**
1. **Gang up on him** with multiple strong fighters
   - Grog + Dolan + Ash = recommended team
   - 3-4 physical attackers converging
2. Don't let him heal repeatedly
   - Kill quickly with focused attacks
   - 3-4 attacks should be enough (40+ damage each)
3. Watch out for counterattacks
   - High AT = hurts to get hit
   - Attack with full HP characters only

**Spell Support:**
- Zohar: Phase Shift or Roman Fire (if Zoot near other enemies)
- Sara: Keep attackers healed

### Alternative Speed Strategy (Shotgunnova)

For experienced players who want faster completion:

**Turn 1 - Aggressive Opening:**
1. **Ash:** Move 3 spaces east toward center building
   - Draws ALL Centurions toward him Turn 2
2. **Zohar:** Position for **Phase Shift** or **Roman Fire**
   - Use **Mystic Shield** on Zohar for survival
   - AOE magic hits grouped Centurions
3. **Diego:** If Bowman = climb to center building roof
   - Can assist in all directions with ranged attacks

**Turn 2 - Mass Counterattack:**
1. All Centurions attack Ash
2. **Counterattacks** send them to deaths
3. Zohar's AOE from Turn 1 softened them
4. Diego snipes Blood Bats from rooftop
5. Boulder push through remaining enemies

**Risks:**
- Ash takes heavy damage (needs healing support)
- Zohar must survive enemy turn (Mystic Shield essential)
- Faster but more dangerous

{: .note }
> This strategy is NOT recommended for first-time players. Stick to defensive approach unless experienced and well-equipped.

### Recommended Party Composition

**Frontline:**
- Ash (Hero/Champion) - main damage
- Grog (Knight/Swordsman) - tank
- Dolan (Knight/Swordsman) - boulder pusher + fighter

**Ranged:**
- Diego (Archer/Bowman or Airman/Hawknight) - Blood Bat hunter
- Zohar (Mage/Sorceror) - AOE magic

| (7,16) | IRONBOOT | N tower, X-marks-the-spot tile | Heavy armor boots |
| (14,2) | **TAROT** | SE corner, X-marks-the-spot | **CHAOS KEY ITEM!** |

{: .danger }
> **TAROT IS CRITICAL!** This is Collector's Treasure #2 of 3 needed for Chaos Key (Trial #4). You need: MACROMAN (Act 2) + **TAROT (Act 3)** + RAMEN (Act 4). Missing it locks you out of Trial #4!

### Special Map Features

**Regeneration Square:**
- Location: (7,16) - same tile as IRONBOOT secret
- Heals HP and MP each turn when standing on it
- Free healing for extended battles
- Useful for MP recovery

**Boulders:**
- Can be pushed for enemy damage
- Strategic positioning tools

**Multi-Level Terrain:**
- Central building with roof access
- Height advantage for archers

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Medium - "Kinda hard"

Standard tactical battle with emphasis on proper positioning and target prioritization. The challenge is managing enemy groups while collecting valuable secrets.

#### Recommended Strategy: Tight Phalanx Formation

**Setup & Turn 1:**

**Party Positioning:**
1. **Keep party together** at start
2. Move to their right (eastward)
3. **Position Ash behind boulder** (can push later)
4. **Form defensive line 1 square back from small castle**
   - This prevents enemies from reaching you Turn 1
   - Forces enemies to group up for AOE magic
5. **Tight phalanx formation:**
   - Front: Ash, Grog, Dolan (fighters)
   - Middle: Diego (ranged)
   - Rear: Zohar, Sara, Huxley (magic/healing)

**Why This Works:**
- Enemies must approach through chokepoint
- Boulder can be pushed into enemy masses
- AOE magic hits grouped enemies
- Supports can heal from safety

**Turn 2 - Boulder & Magic Assault:**

**Boulder Push:**
1. **Ash** (or whoever positioned behind boulder) pushes it
2. Boulder rolls toward enemies
3. Hits multiple targets for 30-50 damage
4. Softens Centurions/Grenadiers significantly

**Zohar's Magic:**
1. Move forward into position
2. **Rolling Fire** to hit 3 enemies (if available as Hero spell from Ash?)
   - Wait, this might be from different battle
3. **Phase Shift** or **Piercing Light** on grouped enemies
   - Position to hit 3 enemies if possible with Phase Shift field
   - ~50+ damage to each

**Formation Advance:**
1. Move everyone forward together
2. Form **tight phalanx** behind and next to Ash
3. Stay in mutual support range
4. No one gets isolated

**Turn 3+ - Priority Target Elimination:**

**Kill Order:**
1. **Warlock** - "I took my flying guy and killed the warlock quickly, cuz he sucks"
   - Diego (if Hawknight) flies to Warlock
   - One-shot with ranged attack or melee
   - Eliminates RAINBOW STROKE threat (~50 AOE damage)
2. **Blood Bats** - Paralysis threat
   - Diego or other archers focus fire
   - Eliminate both as soon as possible
3. **Deacon** - Healing support
   - Prevents enemy healing
4. **Centurions** - Main threats
   - Clean up with frontline fighters
5. **Grenadiers** - Last priority
   - **Leave 1 alive** for safe treasure collection

{: .important }
> **Flying Unit Priority:** If you have Diego or Amon as Hawknight/Sky Lord, send them directly to the Warlock. RAINBOW STROKE can devastate your party if allowed to cast repeatedly.

#### Alternative Strategy: Aggressive Opening (Shotgunnova)

**Turn 1 - Ash as Bait:**
1. **Ash:** Move east to nearest tree by center building
2. Draws ALL Centurions toward him Turn 2
3. **Zohar:** Position for AOE magic
   - **Mystic Shield** on Zohar to ensure survival
   - Ready Phase Shift/Roman Fire for Turn 2

**Turn 2 - Mass Counterattack:**
1. All Centurions attack Ash
2. **Counterattacks** severely damage them
3. Zohar's AOE from Turn 1 finishes them
4. Diego handles Blood Bats from center building roof

**Risks:**
- Ash takes 4 attacks = ~60-100 damage total
- Requires good armor and Megaherb ready
- Faster but more dangerous

#### Treasure Collection Strategy

**Timing:**
1. Fight to comfortable position
2. Kill all enemies **except 1 Grenadier or 1 Deacon**
3. Collect chests and secrets safely
4. Kill last enemy

**Collection Order:**

**Priority 1 - TAROT (CRITICAL!):**
1. Send fast character to SE corner
2. Coordinates: (14,2) - "Plus-shape tile by SE tree" or "Cross-shaped dirt"
3. X marks the spot on ground
4. Search → **TAROT**
5. **VERIFY YOU HAVE IT** before finishing battle!

**Priority 2 - Megaherb Chest (South):**
1. Character moves to (9,4)
2. Open chest → MEGAHERB

**Priority 3 - Mage Gem Chest (NE):**
1. Character moves to (14,18)
2. Open chest → MAGE GEM
3. Equip on Zohar or Eleni for +8 magic attack

**Priority 4 - IRONBOOT Secret:**
1. Character moves to (7,16)
2. Regen square at N tower area
3. "Weird wall tile by N boulder" - X marks spot
4. Search → IRONBOOT
5. Bonus: Standing on this tile heals HP/MP!

{: .note }
> **Secret Finding:** "Buried items easier with grenadier alive - they rarely position for counterattack." Leave a Grenadier alive while treasure hunting.

### Spell Usage

**Zohar (Sorceror):**
- **Phase Shift:** When 2-3 enemies grouped
  - R3-7, F1 = can hit area
  - ~50+ damage to Centurions
- **Roman Fire:** Tighter groups
  - Good against bunched enemies
- Conserve MP for upcoming battles

**Sara/Huxley (Bishops):**
- Healing as needed
- Can use offensive spells against Warlock if needed

**Ash (Champion):**
- Physical attacks main strategy
- Save Hero spells for boss battles

### Post-Battle

**Story Events - Major Plot Development:**

**Scene: Dolf, Hel, and Villains:**
- **Magic Stone revealed** - contains spark of original Flames of Judgment
- **Royal Ring** - lost artifact of Ashah Dynasty that checks Magic Stone's power
- Dolf's revolutionary plans exposed
- **Kira's loyalty wavering** - having second thoughts about serving Dolf
- Dolf blames Ash's party for Kira's family losses
- **Xeno appears** - "a cool lookin dude"
- Xeno is told to **watch Kira** (she's under surveillance)

{: .note }
> **Kira's Conflict:** Former ally Kira is questioning her loyalty to Dolf. This sets up her eventual betrayal of Dolf to help your party.

**Key Lore:**
- **Flames of Justice** from Toroah history are sealed in Magic Stone
- Royal Ring of Ashah Dynasty contains/controls this power
- Dolf and Hel are searching for the Royal Ring

**Next Destination:** Reed Highway

**Preparation:**
- Check equipment after battle
- Ensure party is healed
- Verify you have **TAROT** in inventory!
- Next battle has unique escape mechanics

---

## Battle 3.4: Reed Highway - Prevent Escape

**Recommended Level:** 17
**Map Size:** 48×12 grid (**very long map** - longest in game!)
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Ash OR Any enemy escapes off the map

{: .danger }
> **Special Objective:** Don't let ANY enemies escape! Even dogs! If even one enemy exits the map, you **lose the battle**.

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Spells |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-------|
| **Lando Hitman** (Mini-Boss) | 1 | 19 | 126 | 69 | 55 | 66 | SELF HEALING R2 |
| Centurion (Kn) | 2 | 15 | 112 | 65 | 56 | 56 | None |
| C. Archer (Bo) | 2 | 15 | 100 | 56 | 45 | 53 | None |
| Guarddog (Mo) | 4 | 18 | 123 | 60 | 56 | 76 | None |

**Total Gold:** 5,500 G

{: .note }
> **Guarddogs:** New enemy type - Monk class with high HP and agility. Fast and durable.

### Treasure & Items

**Chests:** None

**Hidden Items (1):**

| Coordinates | Item | Location Description |
|:------------|:-----|:---------------------|
| (46,5) | M.STAFF | Eastern road crater (Magic Staff) |

### Special Battle Mechanics

**Enemy Behavior - NON-COMBAT!**

{: .important }
> **Enemies will NOT fight back!** This is a pursuit/ambush scenario, not a standard battle.

**Turns 1-4: Standoff Phase**
- Enemies do **NOT attack** during this time
- They're on patrol, unaware of your presence
- You should **NOT attack yet** either
- Use this time to position for ambush

**Turn 5: Enemy Retreat Triggered**
- Lando signals all enemies to flee
- Attempting to escape and warn rebel forces
- Enemies start running toward eastern exit
- They will **not fight** - only flee
- **You must stop them from escaping!**

{: .warning }
> **Timing Critical:** "Wait until Ash says nothing on Turn 5" - Don't attack early or you mess up the strategy!

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Easy/Fun - "Basic" with unique mechanics

This is one of the most unique battles in the game. Instead of enemies attacking you, you're setting up an ambush and trap to prevent their escape.

#### Turn-by-Turn Strategy

**Turns 1-4: Setup Phase (DO NOT ATTACK!)**

**Positioning Strategy:**

**Party Deployment:**
1. **Move party into trees** on either side of road
   - Hide in groves flanking the highway
   - East and west sides
2. **Huxley:** Hide near gate in west
   - Special mission for him
3. **Everyone else:** Ambush positions
   - Surround enemies without engaging
   - Cut off escape routes

**Turn 4 Preparation:**
1. **Huxley:** Move to western gate switch
2. **Fast characters:** Move toward eastern crate
3. **Combat characters:** Surround enemy patrol
4. **Wait for Turn 5** before attacking

Author's Quote:
> "Wait until Ash says nothing, NOT, I do not mean he says '........', the turn after that, he doesn't say anything. Thats turn 5, thats when you attack."

**Turn 5: Spring the Trap!**

**Immediate Actions:**

**1. Huxley Lowers the Bridge:**
- Hit switch to lower western gate
- Opens access to western box area

**2. Zohar's Opening Salvo:**
- Move near road
- **Phase Shift** into enemy masses
- Hits multiple enemies for ~50+ damage
- Softens them for physical attackers

**3. Mass Bombardment:**
- Attack with EVERYTHING
- "Bombard with everything (including priests' offensive)"
- All characters unleash attacks
- AOE spells preferred
- Priests can use offensive magic

**4. Start Crate Mission:**
- Send character west toward box/crate
- Will block small footbridge path
- Critical for trapping enemies

**Turns 6+: The Rat Trap**

**Enemy Behavior After Turn 5:**
- Enemies flee toward exits (east and west)
- They **do not fight back** even when attacked
- Lando and those near boss try to come back east
- Those further west go toward Huxley and the box
- "Finest rat trap ever constructed!"

**Execution:**

**Eastern Group:**
1. Kill enemies fleeing eastward first
   - They're closest to exit = highest priority
   - Cut off escape route
2. Surround and eliminate
3. Don't let ANY reach eastern edge

**Western Group:**
1. **Push crate onto walkway** ASAP
   - Blocks footbridge path
   - Traps enemies on one side
2. Enemies trapped on other side of walkway
3. Bring party from rear to eliminate them
4. Surrounded and destroyed

**Lando (Mini-Boss):**
- Has SELF HEALING R2 (~30 HP recovery)
- Higher HP and stats than others
- Kill quickly with multiple attackers to prevent healing
- Don't let him escape!

### Alternative Speed Strategy

**Aggressive Turn 5 Assault:**

**Opening Move:**
1. **Zohar:** Phase Shift into center of enemy formation
2. **All ranged units:** Fire into masses
3. **Priests:** Offensive spells (Piercing Light, etc.)
4. Kill as many as possible Turn 5

**Pursuit:**
1. Fast units (Hawknights, Monks) pursue fleeing enemies
2. Block eastern escape route
3. Crate blocks western escape
4. Cleanup survivors

**Key Points:**
- Focus on killing fleeing enemies (those moving toward exits)
- Ignore enemies fleeing away from exits (they can't escape that way)
- AOE spells maximize damage

### Map Positioning

**48 Squares Wide:**
- This is the longest map in the game!
- Takes many turns to traverse end-to-end
- Makes escape prevention challenging
- Requires fast units or good positioning

**Key Locations:**
1. **Western Gate/Switch:** Huxley's target
2. **Western Crate/Box:** Must be pushed onto footbridge
3. **Eastern Road:** M.Staff secret location (46,5)
4. **Center Road:** Where patrol walks
5. **Tree Groves:** Your hiding spots (east and west of road)

### Treasure Collection

**M.Staff (Magic Staff):**
- Location: Eastern road crater (46,5)
- Not critical item
- "Not that important (saves currency)"
- Collect if convenient, don't risk for it

**Collection Timing:**
1. Prioritize stopping escapes
2. After enemies secured/dead, grab M.Staff
3. Send fast character to (46,5)
4. Search crater → M.STAFF

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Attacking Early (Turns 1-4):**
- Ruins ambush setup
- Alerts enemies prematurely
- Harder battle

**❌ Not Blocking Exits:**
- Letting enemies reach map edges = instant defeat
- Must secure both east and west exits

**❌ Ignoring the Crate:**
- Crate blocks western footbridge
- Essential for trapping western fleeing enemies
- Don't forget Huxley's mission!

**❌ Focusing on Damage Instead of Control:**
- Goal is prevent escape, not maximize kills
- Kill fleeing enemies first
- Can clean up trapped enemies later

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Wait until Turn 5
- Spring coordinated ambush
- Block both exits
- Kill fleeing enemies first
- Trap and eliminate remainder

### Post-Battle

**Story Events - Prison Rescue Setup:**

**Scene: In the Prison**
- POV shifts to imprisoned allies
- **Clint** is in jail (still captured from Act 2)
- **Claymore** is with him (resistance fighter)
- **Darius** is also imprisoned (new character)
- Claymore talks about Hel and Dolf's search for **Royal Ring**
- **Kira appears and rescues them!**
  - She's betraying Dolf to help the heroes
  - Secretly switching sides
  - Gets prisoners out

**New Character Acquired:**
- **Darius** (Archer, Level 14)
- Will be playable in next battle
- Acts 3-6 archer character

{: .note }
> **Kira's Betrayal:** She's gone from spy to secret helper. This confirms her doubts from the earlier scene with Xeno.

**Next Battle Preview:**
- Author's Quote: "The following battle takes forever"
- Prison dungeon with unique mechanics
- Playing as **Clint's party** (not Ash!)
- Jailbreak scenario

**Preparation:**
- Next battle uses Clint, Eleni, Amon, Darius
- Different party than usual
- Check their equipment before battle

---

## Battle 3.5: Prison Fortress - Juggernaut Maze

**Recommended Level:** 15 (for Clint's party)
**Map Size:** 24×16 grid
**Victory Condition:** Destruction of all enemies
**Defeat Condition:** Death of Clint

{: .warning }
> **Ash Not Available!** This is **Clint's battle**. Protect Clint - **his death means Game Over!** (not Ash's)

{: .danger }
> **Author's Quote:** "This one sux." - Tedious battle with unique enemy mechanics and maze navigation.

### Party Available

**Player-Controlled (4 characters):**
- **Clint** (Knight/Swordsman) - Main character for this battle
- **Eleni** (Mage/Sorceror) - Magic support
- **Amon** (Archer/Bowman) - Ranged attacks
- **Darius** (NEW - Archer) - Ranged attacks

{: .note }
> **New Character:** **Darius** joins the party for this battle. Level 14 archer.

### Enemy Composition

| Enemy Type | Count | Level | HP | AT | DF | AGL | Special Mechanic |
|:-----------|:------|:------|:---|:---|:---|:----|:-----------------|
| Juggernaut (Ar) | 8-9 | 13 | 112 | 64 | 69 | 37 | **Rear attack only!** |
| Mimic (Mo) | 2 | 18 | 123 | 60 | 56 | 76 | Hidden in chests! |

**Total Gold:** 6,000 G

### Juggernaut Combat Mechanics

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL RULE:** You can **ONLY** damage Juggernauts by attacking from **BEHIND!** Front and side attacks deal **NO damage!**

**Damage Rules:**
- **Front attack:** 0 damage (completely immune)
- **Side attack:** 0 damage (completely immune)
- **Rear attack (physical):** **One-hit kill!** (OHKO - except Eleni)
- **Rear attack (Eleni physical):** Damage but not OHKO
- **Magic (Eleni):** CAN kill Juggernauts regardless of position
  - Phase Shift, Roman Fire, etc. bypass rear-only rule
  - Usually not OHKO with magic, but effective

**Author's Quote:**
> "As Darius says: 'It's worthless to hit the Juggernauts anywhere but from behind'"

{: .important }
> **Eleni Exception:** Eleni's physical attacks are too weak to OHKO Juggernauts even from behind. However, her **magic can kill them** from any direction!

### Treasure & Items

**Chests (6 total, 2 are MIMICS!):**

| # | Location | Coordinates | Contents | Safe? |
|:--|:---------|:------------|:---------|:------|
| C1 | Entrance area | (7,11) | **MIMIC MONSTER** | ❌ TRAP! |
| C2 | By N gate | (9,12) | MEGAHERB | ✓ Safe |
| C3 | Inside N gate, first | (15,12) | **MIMIC MONSTER** | ❌ TRAP! |
| C4 | Inside N gate, second | (17,12) | S.STAFF (Spirit Staff) | ✓ Safe |
| C5 | E side of map, S of NE gate | (20,8) | MEGAHERB | ✓ Safe |
| C6 | SE corner | (22,1) | GRIMHELM (armor) | ✓ Safe |

{: .danger }
> **Mimic Warning:** Chests C1 and C3 contain **Mimic Monsters** (aggressive enemies)! They attack when the chest is opened. Mimics are Level 18 with 123 HP - very dangerous!

**Hidden Items:** None

### Special Map Features

**Switch & Gate Maze:**

The dungeon uses a switch-and-gate system to navigate:

**Switch Pattern (in order):**
1. **Middle switch** → Opens SW Gate
2. **SW switch** → Opens N Gate
3. **S switch** → Opens NE Gate & S Gate
4. **NE switch** → Opens Middle Gate

**Navigation Path:**
1. Start at entrance
2. Hit middle switch → SW gate opens
3. Go through SW gate, hit SW switch → N gate opens
4. Two paths available:
   - North gate (recommended for most characters)
   - South path (for split strategy)

{: .note }
> A full ASCII maze map is available in Lancel0t's original FAQ for detailed navigation.

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Hard/Tedious - "This one sux"

This battle is challenging not due to enemy strength, but due to:
1. **Unique combat rules** (rear-attack only)
2. **Maze navigation** (switches and gates)
3. **Mimic traps** (fake chests)
4. **Tedious pacing** (hit and run tactics required)

#### Recommended Strategy: Corridor Trap Method

**Concept:**
Use the starting corridor as a killing zone by trapping Juggernauts between two characters.

**Setup (Lancel0t's Technique):**

**Turn 1 - Positioning:**
1. **Character 1** (e.g., Clint): Move to wall position in starting corridor
2. **Character 2** (e.g., Amon): Position at opposite end facing Character 1
3. Create a "corridor" between them

**Execution (Turns 2+):**
1. Juggernauts approach and attack Character 1 (facing wall)
2. Juggernaut is now facing Character 1
3. **Character 2** (behind Juggernaut) attacks from rear
4. **One-hit kill!**
5. Repeat as Juggernauts enter corridor

**Why This Works:**
- Juggernauts must pass through corridor to reach you
- They face forward to attack
- Character behind them gets free rear attacks
- "Ring around the rosie" with entrance stone circle

{: .note }
> This makes the tedious battle more manageable by creating a predictable kill zone.

#### Alternative Strategy: Split & Conquer (Wolverine)

**Concept:**
Split party to collect treasures while managing Juggernauts separately.

**Turn 1-3: Initial Juggernauts**
1. Three Juggernauts immediately approach entrance
2. Use **treasure chests as barriers**:
   - Character slips around unopened chest
   - Juggernaut attacks and stops at chest
   - Character whacks from behind = instant kill
3. Kill first three Juggernauts this way

**Mid-Battle: Switch Navigation**
1. After first three dead, advance to middle switch
2. **Darius:** Head toward SW switch mission
   - Will draw remaining Juggernauts
   - Leads them on chase
3. **Rest of party:** Go to N Gate
   - Collect treasures in N area
   - Clear Juggernauts methodically

**Execution:**
1. Send Darius SW → Opens gates in sequence
2. Juggernauts chase Darius (useful distraction!)
3. Rest of party clears N gate area
4. Get chests C2, C3 (Mimic!), C4
5. Eventually meet up in middle
6. Clean up remaining Juggernauts

#### Mimic Management

**Mimic Chest Strategy:**

**Identification:**
- **C1** (left of entrance) = MIMIC
- **C3** (first inside N gate) = MIMIC
- All others safe

**Handling Mimics:**

**Preparation:**
1. **Kill nearby Juggernauts first** before opening Mimic chests
   - Don't mix Mimics and Juggernauts!
   - Author: "Don't mix in Mimics until Juggernauts in immediate area dispatched"
2. Have backup characters ready
3. Heal characters to full HP

**Opening:**
1. Character opens chest → Mimic appears
2. **Gang up with archers** (Amon + Darius)
   - Ranged attacks from safety
   - 2-3 arrows should kill
3. Someone deals finishing blow

**Mimic Stats:**
- Level 18, 123 HP
- High AT and AGL
- Dangerous if not prepared
- Can kill weakened characters

#### Treasure Collection Strategy

**Safe Chests (Collect These):**

**C2 (Megaherb):**
- By N gate at (9,12)
- Safe to open
- Healing item

**C4 (Spirit Staff):**
- Inside N gate, second chest (17,12)
- Safe to open
- Magical weapon for priests

**C5 (Megaherb):**
- E side of map (20,8)
- Safe to open
- Healing item

**C6 (Grimhelm):**
- SE corner (22,1) - hardest to reach
- Safe but difficult to access
- Great armor
- Author: "Great item but hard to get"

**Grimhelm Collection (Advanced):**
1. Use magic near "B" switch area
2. Eleni can kill one Juggernaut with magic to help
3. Opens path to SE corner
4. Worth the effort - strong armor

**Mimic Chests (Handle With Care):**

**C1 (Mimic):**
- Near entrance
- Kill after first 3 Juggernauts cleared
- Gang up with both archers

**C3 (Mimic):**
- First inside N gate
- Kill after entering N gate area
- Same tactic: gang up with archers

### Combat Tactics

**Physical Attacks (Rear Only):**

**Characters Who Can OHKO:**
- **Clint** (Knight) - main fighter
- **Amon** (Archer) - ranged rear attacks
- **Darius** (Archer) - ranged rear attacks

**Eleni (Cannot OHKO):**
- Physical attacks too weak even from rear
- Use magic instead

**Positioning for Rear Attacks:**
1. Lure Juggernaut to face one direction
2. Circle around to rear
3. Attack from behind
4. Instant kill

**Magic Strategy (Eleni):**

**Advantages:**
- Bypasses rear-attack requirement
- Can damage from any direction
- Safe from distance

**Spells to Use:**
- **Phase Shift** (if Sorceror): Best option
  - R3-7, F1 = can hit from afar
  - ~50+ damage (not OHKO but effective)
  - Can hit multiple if grouped
- **Roman Fire** (if Sorceror): Backup AOE
- **Piercing Light** (if Mage): Single target

**Execution:**
1. Position Eleni at safe distance
2. Cast magic at Juggernauts
3. Finish with physical attacks if needed
4. Eleni gets extra EXP this way

{: .important }
> **EXP Focus:** "Magic gives Eleni extra EXP" - Good opportunity to level her toward Phase Shift if she doesn't have it yet!

### Resource Management

{: .warning }
> **Critical:** "HERBS FAR MORE USEFUL in next battle - conserve!" Don't waste healing items unnecessarily!

**Healing Item Conservation:**
- Use Sara's healing if available (wait, Sara isn't in this battle)
- Actually, you have NO PRIEST in this party!
- Only healing: **Herbs and Megaherbs**
- Conserve for next battle (very difficult boss fight)

**MP Management:**
- Eleni is only caster
- Use magic sparingly
- Focus on physical rear-attacks when possible
- Save MP for next battle's magic needs

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Frontal Assault:**
- Attacking Juggernauts from front = 0 damage
- Wasting turns on ineffective attacks

**❌ Opening Mimic Chests Early:**
- Opening Mimics while Juggernauts nearby
- Getting overwhelmed by multiple enemy types

**❌ Wasting Healing Items:**
- Using Megaherbs carelessly
- Next battle is harder - save items!

**❌ Rushing Through:**
- Not using chests as barriers
- Getting surrounded

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Always attack from behind
- Use chests as positioning tools
- Kill Juggernauts before opening Mimic chests
- Conserve healing items
- Use Eleni's magic to bypass mechanics

### Post-Battle

**Story Events:**
- Party escapes to outside
- **Dungeon Keeper appears** - threatens death
- "Situation looks dire"
- Sets up final battle of Act 3

{: .warning }
> **Immediate Next Battle:** Prison Battlements boss fight begins right after. Check HP/MP levels!

**Preparation:**
- Use any remaining Herbs if characters damaged
- Check Eleni's MP (needs magic for next fight)
- Verify equipment
- **Next battle is VERY TOUGH** - boss does "MEGA damage"

### Battle Strategy

**Difficulty Assessment:** Very Hard - "VERY TOUGH!!!"

This is a grueling battle combining:
1. **Split party start** (4 vs 17 enemies)
2. **Reinforcements delayed** (arrive Turn 2)
3. **Dangerous boss** (MEGA damage)
4. **Support enemies** (healers, mages)
5. **Two-front battle** (yard and battlements)

#### Phase 1: Desperate Defense (Round 1)

{: .danger }
> **Round 1 is Critical!** Clint's group must survive against overwhelming odds until reinforcements arrive.

**Starting Situation:**
- **Clint's 4 characters** boxed in yard
- **17 enemies** surrounding on 3 sides:
  - Grenadiers on elevated positions (3 sides)
  - Juggernauts + Centurions on ground floor
  - Warlocks, Deacons, Blood Bats scattered

**Turn 1 - Clint's Party Positioning:**

**Eleni (CRITICAL - Must Survive!):**
1. **Move FAR from Juggernauts** (priority #1!)
2. Position for **Roman Fire** or **Phase Shift**
   - Target: Both Juggernauts if possible
   - ~100+ damage to each
   - Softens or kills them
3. Stay out of Warlock range if possible

{: .danger }
> **Eleni's Survival:** "Assuming Eleni survived" - She is critical for magic support! If she dies Round 1, battle becomes much harder.

**Clint:**
1. Move toward **SW corner** of yard
2. **Distance from Warlocks** critical
   - RAINBOW STROKE will kill over time
   - Get out of their 5-range
3. Position to receive healing from bishops (arrive Turn 2 on SW wall)

**Amon/Darius (Archers):**
1. Position for ranged attacks
2. "Do whatever (unlikely to be targeted)"
3. Support Eleni if possible
4. Stay mobile

**Expected Round 1 Results:**
- Eleni damages/kills Juggernauts with magic
- Grenadiers fire arrows (moderate damage)
- Warlocks may cast RAINBOW STROKE
- Centurions engage in melee
- Party takes heavy damage but survives

#### Phase 2: Reinforcements Arrive (Round 2)

**Ash's Party Enters:**
- Appear on **SW upper wall** (battlements)
- 7 additional characters join
- Can now fight on two fronts

**Why Clint Moved SW Round 1:**
- **Bishops can heal him** from wall above!
- Sara/Huxley have range to reach yard
- Critical support for surviving Round 2

**Round 2 - Ash's Party Actions:**

**Priority Targets (Battlements):**
1. **Kill Warlock by Ash ASAP!**
   - RAINBOW STROKE is deadly
   - Zohar can Phase Shift
   - Ash can melee
   - Eliminate before multiple casts
2. Clear enemies on wall
3. Boulder kicking if available
4. Support yard party with ranged/magic

**Healers (Sara/Huxley):**
1. **Heal Clint immediately** if wounded
   - Keep him alive = no game over
2. **Bring Megaherb to Eleni** if she survived but wounded
3. Position inside wall to reach both fronts

**Round 2 - Clint's Party Actions:**

**Eleni Options:**
1. **Option A:** Park under Dumas' overhang
   - Cast **Roman Fire** on Bats & Grenadiers
   - Safe from some attacks
2. **Option B:** Pull back to wall where Ash's party is
   - Safer positioning
   - Can combine magic with Zohar

**Clint/Archers:**
1. Continue clearing yard enemies
2. Focus on Centurions and Grenadiers
3. Avoid Juggernauts (rear-attack only)

#### Phase 3: Two-Front Battle (Rounds 3-5)

**Objective Priorities:**

**1. Clear Dangerous Enemies:**
- **Warlocks** (both - RAINBOW STROKE threat)
- **Blood Bats** (all 3 - paralysis)
- **Deacons** (both - healing support)

**2. Collect Critical Items:**
- **MANA KEY** (must get!)
- **GOLDCOIN** (nice bonus)

**3. Set Up Dumas Fight:**
- Clear surrounding enemies first
- Position party for boss assault

**Split Operations:**

**Yard Team (Clint's Group + Some of Ash's):**
1. Clear Juggernauts (rear attacks)
2. Kill Blood Bats (paralysis prevention)
3. Eliminate Grenadiers
4. Clear path to Dumas

**Battlements Team (Rest of Ash's Group):**
1. Kill Warlocks (critical!)
2. Descend stairs
3. Clear Centurions
4. Support yard team

**Item Collection Missions:**

**GOLDCOIN (Lower Priority):**
1. Split off someone to (9,1)
2. Spiral marked tile on outer lower level
3. Search → GOLDCOIN

**MANA KEY (CRITICAL!):**
1. **Hit switch** to lower wall
   - Switch location: (3,6-7-8) area
   - Opens gate to western outer area
2. Send **Archer or Hawknight** ASAP
   - Fast movement critical
   - Diego (if Hawknight) ideal - can fly
3. Move to (0,15) - NW corner
4. Fractured crater / cracked hole / "hole tile"
5. Search → **MANA KEY**
6. **VERIFY YOU HAVE IT!**

{: .danger }
> **DO NOT FINISH BATTLE WITHOUT MANA KEY!** This is the ONLY opportunity to get it. Missing it locks you out of Trial #3 forever!

**Clean Up Descending Enemies:**
1. Some enemies will descend stairs from battlements
2. Kill them in stairwell
3. Don't let them surround yard party

#### Phase 4: Dumas Boss Fight (Rounds 5+)

**Preparation:**
1. All other enemies dead (or only Dumas remains)
2. Party regrouped
3. HP/MP topped off
4. **MANA KEY collected**

**Boss Strategy:**

**Gang Up Assault:**
1. Author used: **Grog + Dolan + Ash + Zohar** together
2. Recommended: 4+ strong characters converging
3. Surround Dumas if possible

**Execution:**

**Softening Phase:**
1. **Zohar:** Phase Shift or Roman Fire
   - ~50+ damage
   - Long-range, safe
2. **Archers:** Ranged attacks
   - 30-40 damage each
   - Stay at distance
3. Bring Dumas to ~50 HP

**Finishing Phase:**
1. **Do NOT corner Dumas**
   - Author: "Make sure he's in the open"
   - Cornering gives him advantage
2. **Hit and run if needed:**
   - If he chases Clint: harass from distance
   - If he chases Ash: back up until ready
3. **Final push when ready:**
   - "Hit him with everything you have"
   - Multiple melee attackers at once
   - Finish quickly before he self-heals

**Vorpal Chain Warning:**
- 100+ damage attack
- Can kill weaker characters
- Keep characters at full HP when engaging
- Have healing ready

**Self-Healing:**
- Can heal ~30 HP
- Kill quickly to minimize healing
- Focused assault prevents multiple heals

### Spell Usage

- **Phase Shift:** R3-7, F1
  - Round 1: Hit both Juggernauts
  - Later: Hit grouped enemies
  - Vs Dumas: Safe long-range damage
- **Roman Fire:** Alternative AOE
  - Good against Bats & Grenadiers
- Conserve MP for Dumas fight

**Zohar (Sorceror):**
- **Phase Shift:** Main weapon
  - Kill Warlock Round 2
  - AOE damage to groups
  - Soften Dumas
- **Piercing Light:** Single targets
- Focus on high-priority threats

**Sara/Huxley (Bishops):**

  - Also heal Eleni Round 2
  - Top off party before Dumas
- **Supreme Healing:** Party-wide if available

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Eleni Dies Round 1:**
- Moving her too close to Juggernauts
- Loss of critical magic support
- Battle becomes much harder

**❌ Forgetting MANA KEY:**
- Finishing battle without collecting it
- Permanently locked out of Trial #3
- Always verify in inventory!

**❌ Not Healing Clint:**
- Clint death = game over (not Ash!)
- Must prioritize his survival
- Bishops should focus on him

**❌ Ignoring Warlocks:**
- RAINBOW STROKE accumulates damage
- Multiple casts = party wipe
- Must kill early

**❌ Cornering Dumas:**
- Boss gets advantage when cornered
- Keep him in open space
- Hit and run better

**✓ Correct Approach:**
- Survive Round 1 with Eleni alive
- Heal Clint/Eleni Round 2
- Kill Warlocks ASAP
- Collect MANA KEY before finishing
- Gang up on Dumas in open
- Verify key in inventory!

- ✓ Zen Robe boss drop (automatic)

**Conserve Resources:**

**Character Management:**
- Advance Zohar to Sorceror ASAP (Phase Shift critical!)

- Remember Clint = protagonist in 3.5 & 3.6 (not Ash!)

### Common Pitfalls

- Only available in 3.3
- Required for Chaos Trial later
- Locks you out if missed

**❌ Missing MANA KEY:**
- Only available in 3.6
- Required for Mana Trial
- Permanently missable

**❌ Not Advancing Zohar:**
- Joining at Level 14 (can advance immediately)
- Phase Shift makes Tower Defense much easier
- Critical for later battles

**❌ Wasting Herbs in 3.5:**
- Next battle (3.6) is much harder
- Save healing items for boss fight

**❌ Clint Dies in 3.5/3.6:**
- Clint = protagonist in these battles
- His death = game over (not Ash!)
- Prioritize keeping him alive

### Difficulty Assessment by Battle

**Easiest:**
1. 3.0 (Plain of Sorrow) - Tutorial level
2. 3.4 (Reed Highway) - Fun pursuit, enemies don't fight

**Medium:**
1. 3.1 (Tower Defense) - Unique but manageable
2. 3.3 (Basil Gate) - Standard tactical battle

**Hardest:**
1. **3.6 (Prison Fortress II)** - "VERY TOUGH" boss battle
2. **3.2 (Terasu Village)** - "Much harder than it looks" gang-up AI
3. 3.5 (Prison Fortress) - Tedious Juggernaut mechanics

### Next Steps

**After Act 3:**
- Full party of 12 reunited
- Mana Trial accessible (if key collected)
