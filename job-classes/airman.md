## Overview

{: .important }
> "Airmen class characters are great. Powerful attackers, especially potent against normal melee fighters. Excellent range, not hindered by obstacles, enemies, or even water." - Jeff Chan

The **Airman class** is rated 7/10 by FAQ authors - a strong tactical choice for players who value mobility over safety. Airmen trade the Archer's safety for unparalleled battlefield control through flight, making them excellent for aggressive players and specific tactical situations.

**Weaknesses:** **Vulnerable to Archers** (take bonus damage)

**Restriction:** **Cannot open treasure chests** (flying units can't interact with ground)

{: .warning }
> **Critical Weakness:** Enemy archers deal bonus damage to Airmen. Single arrow can take them down if not careful!

---

## Why Airman is 7/10

### The Mobility Advantage

**Flight Capability:**
- **Ignore terrain** - Mountains, water, walls don't matter
- **Ignore enemies** - Fly over enemy front line
- **Ignore obstacles** - No pathfinding issues
- **Very High Move** - Cover huge distances per turn

**Tactical Applications:**
- Bypass enemy front line → attack enemy mages directly
- Cross water/mountains (other units can't)
- Reach high ground instantly
- Flank enemies from unexpected angles
- Escape surrounded positions

{: .note }
> "Not hindered by obstacles, enemies, or even water." - Jeff Chan

### Aggressive Striking Power

**vs Knights (Bonus Damage):**
- Airmen deal **extra damage** to Knight-class enemies
- Knights are common enemy type
- Can eliminate enemy knights quickly
- Strong against heavily-armored targets

**High Attack + Defense:**
- Better stats than ground Archers
- Can survive front-line combat (briefly)
- Hit harder than Archers
- More durable if caught

### Strategic Flexibility

**What Airmen Do Better Than Archers:**
1. **Reach high-priority targets** (enemy mages behind front line)
2. **Cross impassable terrain** (water, mountains)
3. **Reposition quickly** (escape danger, reach objectives)
4. **Flank enemies** (attack from unexpected angles)
5. **Hit Knights hard** (bonus damage)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Terrain Map:
[Your Army]  ← River →  [Enemy Army]
                        [Enemy Mage in back]

Archer: Must find bridge, takes 5+ turns to reach mage
Airman: Flies directly over river, reaches mage in 2 turns
```

## Why Only 7/10 (Archer is 8/10)

### The Archer Weakness

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL VULNERABILITY:** Airmen are **weak to Archer attacks**. Enemy archers deal bonus damage!

**The Problem:**
- Enemy archer shoots airman: **30-50 damage** (with bonus)
- Enemy archer shoots ground archer: 20-30 damage (normal)
- **Bonus damage makes you fragile**

**Practical Impact:**
- 1-2 enemy archers can focus-fire your airman
- Airman dies quickly (2-3 hits)
- Must constantly avoid enemy archers
- **Limits mobility advantage** (can't fly into range of enemy archers)

**Contrast with Ground Archer:**
- Ground archer vs enemy archer: Equal matchup
- Ground archer shoots enemy airman: **Bonus damage**
- Ground archers counter enemy airmen
- **Your airmen get countered by enemy archers**

{: .important }
> "Excessive weakness to Archer type attacks. Single arrow can take them down if not careful." - Jeff Chan

### Cannot Open Chests

**Restriction:**
- Airmen cannot open treasure chests
- Flying = can't interact with ground objects
- Must bring ground unit to open chests
- **Tactical inconvenience**

**Practical Impact:**
- Can't send airman alone to reach secret chest
- Need ground unit to follow
- Slows down chest acquisition
- Minor but annoying limitation

### Limited Usefulness

{: .note }
> "Author personally finds Archers more useful in most instances, but would be bad to completely forego this class." - Jeff Chan

**Why Archer (8/10) > Airman (7/10):**
- **Archer advantage:** Safer (no archer weakness), more consistent
- **Airman advantage:** Mobility, can bypass terrain
- **Verdict:** Archers more reliable in general play
- **But:** Airmen valuable in specific situations

---

## Strategic Analysis

### When Airmen Excel

**Best Use Cases:**
1. **Maps with water/mountains** - Terrain bypass valuable
2. **Enemy has few archers** - Weakness not exploited
3. **Need to reach distant objective** - Speed critical
4. **Enemy mages behind front line** - Fly over to eliminate
5. **Flanking maneuvers** - Surprise attacks from sides/rear

**Example Battles:**
- **Battle 2.3 (Gillbaris)** - Large water sections, airmen bypass
- **Battle 3.5 (Prison Fortress)** - Walls and obstacles, flight useful
- **Battle 5.6 (Northern Ruins)** - Mountains everywhere, airmen shine

### When Archers Are Better

**Archer-Preferred Situations:**
1. **Enemy has many archers** - Your airmen get shredded
2. **Open flat terrain** - No mobility advantage
3. **Earth Trial** - All enemies are archers (airmen terrible here!)
4. **Safe damage priority** - Reliability over mobility
5. **General combat** - Archers more consistent

**Example Battles:**
- **Earth Trial** - All archer enemies, airmen take massive damage
- **Heaven Trial** - Enemy airmen present (your archers counter them)
- **Most standard battles** - Archers safer and equally effective

### The 1-2 Airman Strategy

{: .important }
> **Recommended Party Composition:** 2-3 Archers (ground) + 1-2 Airmen (flying)

**Why This Split:**
- **2-3 Archers:** Reliable ranged damage, counter enemy airmen, safe
- **1-2 Airmen:** Tactical mobility, can exploit terrain, aggressive strikes
- **Balance:** Get mobility when needed without sacrificing safety

**Typical Setup:**
- **Diego:** Airman (Hawknight → Sky Lord) - protagonist's friend, aggressive
- **Kira:** Archer (Bowman → Sniper) - reliable, safe damage
- **Amon:** Archer (Bowman → Sniper) - support, consistent
- **Darius:** Flexible (either path) - joins late, fill gap

**Alternative:**
- **Two airmen** (Diego + Amon) for maximum mobility
- **Two archers** (Kira + Darius) for reliable safety
- Balanced approach

---

## Tactical Applications

### The "Assassin" Strategy

**Target: Enemy Mages**
1. **Round 1:** Enemy mage positions behind front line (safe from ground units)
2. **Your Turn:** Airman flies over enemy front line
3. **Your Action:** Airman shoots enemy mage
4. **Result:** Enemy mage dead before casting Phase Shift
5. **Outcome:** Your party takes zero AOE damage

**Why This Works:**
- Ground units need 4-5 turns to reach back line
- Airman reaches in 1-2 turns
- Enemy mage dies before acting
- **Prevents devastating AOE spells**

### Terrain Bypass

**Water Sections:**
- Ground units: Must find bridge or go around (5-8 extra turns)
- **Airmen:** Fly directly across (0 extra turns)
- Reach objectives faster
- Control key positions before enemies

**Mountain Maps:**
- Ground units: Navigate slopes and paths
- **Airmen:** Fly to peaks directly
- Claim high ground instantly
- Shoot down at enemies (range bonus)

### Flanking Maneuvers

**Standard Approach:**
```
[Enemy Front Line]
[Enemy Back Line]
        ↑
   Your army approaches from front
   Enemies prepared and waiting
```

**Airman Flanking:**
```
[Enemy Front Line]
[Enemy Back Line] ← Airman attacks from side/rear

   Your army approaches from front (distraction)
   Airman flanks from side (they're not watching)
```

**Result:**
- Enemies surprised
- Can't defend multiple directions
- Airman eliminates back-line threats
- Your front-line advances safely

### Emergency Repositioning

**If Airman In Danger:**
1. Enemy closes in on airman (surrounded)
2. **Airman flies away** (ignores enemies blocking path)
3. Repositions to safety
4. Continues attacking next turn

**Ground Unit Equivalent:**
- Ground unit surrounded = dead (can't escape)
- Airman surrounded = flies away (survives)
- **Mobility = escape option**

---

## Weaknesses & Counters

### Extreme Archer Vulnerability

**The Math:**
- Enemy archer vs your airman: **40-50 damage** (with bonus)
- Your airman HP: 90-120
- **2-3 hits = dead airman**

**Enemy Focus Fire:**
- 3 enemy archers target your airman
- 3 × 45 damage = 135 total damage
- **Airman dies instantly**
- Lost valuable unit

**Mitigation:**
- **Avoid enemy archer range** (stay 7+ tiles away)
- Kill enemy archers first (prioritize them)
- Use terrain (hide behind mountains)
- Don't fly into archer killzones

### Cannot Open Chests

**Problem:**
- Airman reaches secret chest location
- Cannot open it (flying restriction)
- Must wait for ground unit to arrive
- Wastes turns

**Solution:**
- Always bring ground unit to maps with chests
- Don't rely solely on airmen for exploration
- Send ground unit + airman together

### Limited Defensive Capability

**If Caught by Multiple Enemies:**
- Airmen have good stats but not invincible
- 3-4 enemies attacking = airman overwhelmed
- High DEF doesn't matter vs overwhelming force
- **Still fragile when focused**

**Prevention:**
- Don't overextend
- Fly in → attack → fly out (hit-and-run)
- Never stay in range of 3+ enemies
- Use mobility to avoid danger

## Combat Strategy

### Standard Battle Role

**Airman Objectives:**
1. **Eliminate enemy mages** (prevent Phase Shift)
2. **Shoot enemy airmen** (before they attack your back line)
3. **Flank enemy formation** (attack from sides/rear)
4. **Control high ground** (reach peaks first)
5. **Avoid enemy archers** (stay out of range!)

### Typical Turn Sequence

**Early Battle (Rounds 1-3):**
1. **Assess enemy archers** - Where are they?
2. **Plot flight path** - Avoid archer range
3. **Fly to priority target** (enemy mage or airman)
4. **Attack** (bow attack)
5. **Reposition** if in danger

**Mid Battle (Rounds 4-7):**
1. Continue targeting high-priority threats
2. Use mobility to avoid concentrated fire
3. Support ground units with flanking
4. Control key terrain positions

**Late Battle (Rounds 8+):**
1. Clean up survivors
2. Assist allies from advantageous positions
3. Use speed to finish fleeing enemies

### Positioning Rules

**DO:**
- Fly high (elevated positions)
- Stay mobile (don't sit still)
- Hit-and-run tactics (attack and retreat)
- Control map edges (flank from sides)

**DON'T:**
- Fly into range of 2+ enemy archers
- Stay still in exposed positions
- Engage multiple enemies alone
- Ignore enemy archer positions

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Making All 4 Characters Airmen
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Temptation:**
- "Flying is awesome, make everyone airmen!"
- Maximum mobility for entire party
- All 4 archers become Sky Lords

**Why It Fails:**
- **Enemy archers shred your entire ranged force**
- All 4 vulnerable to same enemy type
- No ground archers to counter enemy airmen
- Earth Trial becomes nearly impossible
- **Catastrophic weakness**

**Solution:**
- **Make 2-3 Archers** (ground, safe)
- **Make 1-2 Airmen** (flying, mobile)
- Balanced approach = safer

### Mistake #2: Flying Into Archer Killzones
{: .label .label-yellow }
**DANGEROUS!**

**Common Error:**
- "I'll fly straight to enemy mage"
- Path goes through 3 enemy archer ranges
- "I can take a few arrows"

**Why It Fails:**
- Enemy archer 1: 45 damage
- Enemy archer 2: 45 damage
- Enemy archer 3: 45 damage
- **Total: 135 damage, airman dead**
- Lost valuable unit for nothing

**Solution:**
- **Plot flight path carefully**
- Avoid enemy archer ranges (7+ tiles away)
- Go around if necessary
- Better slow approach than dead airman

### Mistake #3: Overextending
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Common Pattern:**
- Fly deep into enemy formation
- Attack enemy mage (success!)
- **Now surrounded by 5 enemies**
- Next turn: All 5 attack your airman
- Airman dies

**Why It's Bad:**
- Mobility tempts aggressive play
- Deep penetration = isolated
- Isolated = focused fire = death
- Trading airman for mage = bad trade

**Solution:**
- **Hit-and-run tactics**
- Fly in → Attack → Fly out
- Never end turn surrounded
- Maintain escape routes

### Mistake #4: Sending Airman Alone for Chest
{: .label .label-yellow }
**INEFFICIENT!**

**Common Error:**
- "Airman fastest, send to get chest"
- Airman reaches chest
- **Cannot open it** (flying restriction)
- Must wait for ground unit
- Wasted turns

**Solution:**
- Send ground unit + airman together
- Or send ground unit alone
- Don't forget airmen can't open chests
- Plan ahead

---

## Advanced Tactics

### The "Bait and Switch"

**Setup:**
1. Ground archers position front (enemy focuses on them)
2. Enemy commits to attacking ground archers
3. **Airman flies behind enemy formation**
4. Airman eliminates enemy back-line (mages, healers)
5. Enemy front-line turns around (wasted turn)
6. Your ground forces advance (enemy distracted)

**Result:**
- Enemy forced to split attention
- Your airman eliminates high-value targets
- Ground forces advance safely

### Elevation Control

**Strategy:**
1. Identify highest points on map
2. **Airman flies to peak immediately** (turn 1)
3. Shoots down at enemies (range bonus)
4. Enemies must climb to reach airman (slow)
5. Airman controls high ground entire battle

**Benefits:**
- Range bonus from elevation
- Difficult for enemies to reach
- Can retreat by flying down (fast)
- Commanding tactical position

### The "Assassin Chain"

**Multi-Turn Strike:**
1. **Turn 1:** Scout enemy formation (identify mage)
2. **Turn 2:** Position airman 8 tiles away (out of archer range)
3. **Turn 3:** Fly 6 tiles forward (into attack range of mage)
4. **Turn 3 action:** Shoot enemy mage (dead)
5. **Turn 4:** Fly back to safety (before enemies react)

**Result:**
- Enemy mage eliminated
- Your airman survives
- No damage taken

### Coordinated Assault

**With Ground Archers:**
1. Ground archers target enemy archers (eliminate airman's counter)
2. **Once enemy archers dead,** airman advances freely
3. Airman flies into enemy formation (now safe)
4. Dominates without archer threat

**Sequence:**
- Rounds 1-3: Ground archers kill enemy archers
- Rounds 4+: Airman goes wild (no counters remaining)

## Trial of Toroah Performance

### Earth Trial - **TERRIBLE**

{: .danger }
> **WARNING:** Earth Trial has ALL ARCHER enemies. Airmen are at extreme disadvantage!

**The Problem:**
- 27 enemies, ALL archers
- Every enemy deals bonus damage to airmen
- Airman takes 40-50 damage per hit
- **Likely to die quickly**

**Solution:**
- Use ground **Archers** for Earth Trial
- Ground archers counter enemy archers
- Save airmen for other trials
- **Don't bring airmen to Earth Trial**

### Other Trials - Moderate

**Nova Trial:**
- Hill assault, mobility useful
- Airman can reach top quickly
- **Good performance**

**Logos Trial:**
- Spiral staircase, 27 enemies
- Flight bypasses slow climb
- **Good performance**

**Heaven Trial:**
- Some enemy airmen present
- Mobility useful for 28 enemies
- But beware enemy archers
- **Moderate performance**

{: .note }
> Airmen perform well in most Trials EXCEPT Earth Trial (avoid).

## Comparison: Airman vs Archer

### Stat Comparison

| Stat | Airman (7/10) | Archer (8/10) |
|:-----|:--------------|:--------------|
| **ATK** | High | Average |
| **DEF** | High | Low |
| **Mobility** | Very High (flying) | Average |
| **Safety** | Low (weak to archers) | High (no weakness) |
| **Terrain** | Ignores all | Normal pathfinding |
| **Flexibility** | High (mobility) | Moderate |
| **Consistency** | Moderate (situational) | High (always useful) |
| **Counters** | Enemy archers (bad) | Enemy airmen (good) |

### When to Choose Airman

**Choose Airman If:**
- ✓ You value mobility over safety
- ✓ You play aggressively
- ✓ You want tactical flexibility
- ✓ You're comfortable managing vulnerability
- ✓ Making 1-2 airmen (not all 4)

### When to Choose Archer

**Choose Archer If:**
- ✓ You value safety and consistency
- ✓ You play defensively
- ✓ You want reliable damage
- ✓ You don't like vulnerability trade-offs
- ✓ Making 2-3 archers (majority of ranged)

{: .important }
> **Recommended:** Make BOTH. 2-3 Archers + 1-2 Airmen = balanced party.
