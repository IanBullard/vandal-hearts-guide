## Overview

{: .danger }
> "To be quite frank, this is, in my opinion, the worse class in the entire game. **You will never get to use either trait. Ever.**" - Jeff Chan

The **Armor class** is universally rated 1/10 by FAQ authors - **the worst class in Vandal Hearts**. Despite having phenomenal ATK and DEF stats, Armor units have such **pathetically low movement** that they never reach combat before battles end. By the time they arrive, your Mages and Archers have already won.

## Class Progression

```
Level 1-9          Level 10-19        Level 20+
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Soldier ──────────> Guardsman ─────> Dragoon
```

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Class | Key "Improvements" |
|:------|:------|:------------------|
| 1-9 | **Soldier** | Normal movement (3-4 tiles) |
| 10-19 | **Guardsman** | **MOVEMENT DROPS TO 2 TILES** (disaster!) |
| 20+ | **Dragoon** | Still only 2 tiles movement (useless) |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** At Level 10, choosing Guardsman **permanently cripples** the character with 2-tile movement. **NEVER CHOOSE THIS PATH!**

---

## Available Characters

| Character | Starting Level | When Joins | **SHOULD Become Armor?** |
|:----------|:--------------|:-----------|:-------------------------|
| **Clint Picard** | 5 | Starting character | **NO! Knight instead!** |
| **Grog Drinkwater** | 11 | Chapter 2, Section 7 | **NO! Knight instead!** |
| **Dolan** | 12 | Chapter 2, Section 6 | **NO! Knight instead!** |

{: .danger }
> **RECOMMENDATION:** Make **ZERO Armor units**. Keep ALL THREE as Knights (6/10, far superior).

## Statistics

### Stat Distribution

| Stat | Rating | Reality |
|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| **ATK** | **Very High** | Excellent (never gets to use it) |
| **DEF** | **Very High** | Phenomenal (never gets to use it) |
| **AGL** | Low | Poor evasion |
| **MAG DEF** | **Low** | Terrible vs magic |
| **MOVE** | **LOW** | **2 TILES** (completely crippling) |

**Strengths:** Strong against Archers (if they could reach them)

**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to magic, **pathetically slow**

## Why Armor is 1/10 (Worst Class)

### The Movement Catastrophe

{: .danger }
> "Range can only be described as **utterly pathetic**. By time it gets halfway toward enemy, battle would have long been over." - Jeff Chan

**The Fundamental Problem:**
- **Armor Movement:** 2 tiles per turn
- **Normal Movement:** 3-4 tiles per turn
- **Typical Battle Length:** 10-15 turns
- **Typical Map Size:** 20-30 tiles from start to enemy

**The Math:**
- Armor total distance in 10 turns: 20 tiles
- Normal unit distance in 10 turns: 30-40 tiles
- **Result:** Armor halfway to enemy when battle ends

**What Actually Happens:**
```
Turn 1:  [Armor] ← 25 tiles → [Enemy Army]
Turn 2:  [Armor] ← 23 tiles → [Enemy Army]
Turn 3:  [Armor] ← 21 tiles → [Enemy Army]
Turn 4:  [Armor] ← 19 tiles → [Enemy Army]
         Meanwhile: Your Mages cast Phase Shift
Turn 5:  [Armor] ← 17 tiles → [Half-dead enemies]
Turn 6:  [Armor] ← 15 tiles → [Few enemies remaining]
Turn 7:  [Armor] ← 13 tiles → [Battle almost over]
Turn 8:  [Armor] ← 11 tiles → [Last enemy dies]
         BATTLE ENDS
         Armor never reached combat
```

{: .important }
> **Armor units literally do not participate in battles.** They walk slowly toward enemies while everyone else wins.

### The "Useless Stats" Paradox

**What Armor Has:**
- **Very High ATK** - Could deal 80-100 damage per hit!
- **Very High DEF** - Could survive 10-15 hits!
- **Excellent tanking** - Could absorb entire enemy army!

**The Cruel Reality:**
- **Can't use ATK** - Never reaches enemies to attack
- **Can't use DEF** - Never gets hit (too far away)
- **Can't tank** - Enemies never encounter Armor unit

{: .warning }
> "Sports rather high attack power and phenomenal defense (actually useful traits). **You will never get to use either trait. Ever.**" - Jeff Chan

**It's Like:**
- Buying fastest sports car in world
- But it has no wheels
- Stats are amazing
- **But fundamentally unusable**

---

## Why Not Just "Walk Faster"?

### You Can't Fix The Movement Problem

**Player Solutions That Don't Work:**

**"I'll start Armor in front!"**
- Armor starts 2 tiles ahead of party
- Normal units catch up in 1-2 turns (move 3-4 vs 2)
- Still arrive late
- **Doesn't fix problem**

**"I'll only move Armor!"**
- Skip moving other units?
- Then enemies kill your unprotected Mages
- Game Over
- **Terrible strategy**

**"Battles will last longer!"**
- Battles last 8-15 turns typically
- Armor needs 15-20 turns to reach back-line enemies
- **Math doesn't work out**

**"I'll position Armor better!"**
- Movement is 2 tiles regardless of positioning
- Can't position your way out of fundamental flaw
- **Physics don't lie**

{: .note }
> There is NO solution. 2-tile movement is **permanently crippling**.

---

## What Happens In Practice

### Typical Battle With Armor Unit

**Your Party:**
- Clint (Armor) + 11 other characters

**Round 1:**
- Everyone: Advance toward enemy
- Clint (Armor): Moves 2 tiles (now 23 tiles from enemy)

**Round 2-5:**
- Archers: Shoot enemies (4-6 tiles range, already shooting)
- Mages: Cast Phase Shift (5 enemies take 60 damage each)
- Clint (Armor): Moves 2 tiles per turn (now 15 tiles from enemy)

**Round 6-8:**
- Knights: Engage enemy front line (melee combat)
- Priests: Heal wounded allies
- Clint (Armor): Moves 2 tiles per turn (now 9 tiles from enemy)

**Round 9:**
- Mages: Cast Phase Shift again (remaining enemies dead)
- Archers: Shoot last survivors
- **BATTLE ENDS** - Victory!

**Clint (Armor): Never reached combat**
- Walked slowly toward enemy for 9 turns
- Never attacked
- Never got attacked
- Never contributed
- **Completely useless**

**Experience Gained:**
- Everyone else: 40-80 exp (participated in combat)
- Clint (Armor): 10 exp (participation bonus only)
- **Falls behind in levels**

## The Late-Game Disaster

### Enemy Mages Make It Even Worse

{: .warning }
> "More and more mage type enemies. Fully capable of wasting Armor class character with one spell." - Jeff Chan

**Chapter 4-6:**
- Many enemy Mages appear
- Enemy Mages cast Phase Shift
- **Armor has LOW MAG DEF**

**What Happens:**
- Enemy Mage casts Phase Shift on your party
- Hits everyone in 3x3 to 4x4 area
- Mages/Archers: Take 40-50 damage (have high MAG DEF)
- **Armor unit: Takes 80-100 damage** (low MAG DEF)
- Armor unit dies instantly

**The Irony:**
- Armor has highest physical DEF (survives physical attacks)
- Armor has lowest MAG DEF (dies to magic)
- **Enemy Mages counter Armor completely**

{: .important }
> Armor units are **more vulnerable** than normal units because low MAG DEF + can't reach enemy mages to stop them.

### The "Babysitting" Problem

**What You Must Do:**
- Position Armor unit away from enemy Mages
- Spend turns moving Armor to safety
- "Protect" Armor from magic damage
- **Waste turns on useless unit**

**Jeff Chan's Assessment:**
> "Must devote precious turns keeping Armor characters away from enemy mages. Turns essentially wasted."

**The Absurdity:**
- Armor supposed to be tank (protect others)
- **Reality:** YOU must protect Armor (from magic)
- Complete role reversal
- **Fundamentally broken**

## Comparison: Armor vs Knight

**Armor (1/10) vs Knight (6/10):**

| Aspect | Armor (1/10) | Knight (6/10) |
|:-------|:-------------|:--------------|
| **ATK** | Very High (90) | High (70) |
| **DEF** | Very High (60) | High (45) |
| **MOVE** | **2 tiles (crippling)** | 3-4 tiles (normal) |
| **Reaches Combat?** | **NO (too slow)** | YES (arrives on time) |
| **Contributes to battles?** | **NO (useless)** | YES (tanks front) |
| **Vulnerable to magic?** | **YES (low MAG DEF)** | Moderate (average MAG DEF) |
| **Viable?** | **NO** | Yes (serviceable) |

**The Verdict:**
- Armor stats: Better
- Armor performance: **Infinitely worse**
- **Movement matters more than stats**

{: .danger }
> **Knight is 6x better than Armor** (6/10 vs 1/10). Always choose Knight!

## Strategic Analysis (Or Lack Thereof)

### No Valid Strategy Exists

**Attempted Strategies:**

**Strategy 1: "Armor as Defensive Anchor"**
- Idea: Armor holds position, enemies come to them
- Reality: Enemies don't reach Armor (Mages kill first)
- **Fails**

**Strategy 2: "Slow Advance Together"**
- Idea: Entire party moves at Armor's pace (2 tiles/turn)
- Reality: Enemy wipes your immobile party with Phase Shift
- **Game Over**

**Strategy 3: "Send Armor Ahead Early"**
- Idea: Armor advances while party waits
- Reality: Armor reaches enemy alone, surrounded, dies
- **Loses valuable unit**

**Strategy 4: "Use Armor vs Archers"**
- Idea: Armor counters archers (type advantage)
- Reality: Your Archers kill enemy archers before Armor arrives
- **Unnecessary**

**Conclusion:**
- Every strategy fails
- **No way to make Armor useful**
- Better to not have Armor at all

## The Only "Benefit"

### Challenge Runs

**If You Want Hard Mode:**
- Make one or more Armor units
- **Deliberately handicap yourself**
- Play with effectively 11 characters instead of 12
- Armor walks slowly, never contributes
- **Self-imposed challenge**

**Valid Reasons:**
- You've beaten game optimally
- You want extra difficulty
- You enjoy handicapped runs
- **You understand it makes game harder**

{: .note }
> This is the ONLY valid reason to make Armor - intentionally choosing hard mode.

## Common "Defenses" of Armor (Debunked)

### "But High DEF Means Tanky!"

**The Logic:**
- Armor has very high DEF
- Can survive many hits
- Best tank in game?

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Tanks must reach enemies to tank**
- Armor never reaches enemies (too slow)
- High DEF useless if never getting hit
- **Can't tank from 15 tiles away**

### "High ATK Means Strong!"

**The Logic:**
- Armor deals 80-100 damage per hit
- More than Knights (70 damage)
- Better damage dealer?

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Must reach enemies to deal damage**
- Armor never reaches enemies (too slow)
- 0 attacks × 100 damage = 0 total damage
- **Knight at 70 damage × 10 attacks = 700 total damage**
- **Armor deals ZERO damage (never attacks)**

### "I'll Use Them In Long Battles!"

**The Logic:**
- Some battles are longer (20+ turns)
- Armor will reach eventually
- Worth it for long battles?

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Even 20-turn battles end before Armor arrives**
- Armor needs 15 turns to reach back-line
- Your Mages end battle in 8-12 turns
- **"Long" isn't long enough**

### "But Dragoon Sounds Cool!"

**The Logic:**
- Dragoon is cool name
- Sounds powerful
- Want to use Dragoons!

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Name doesn't matter if unit is useless
- **Dragoon still has 2-tile movement (crippled)**
- Cool name ≠ viable class
- **Rule of cool doesn't override physics**

## FAQ Authors' Consensus (Universal Condemnation)

### Jeff Chan (Atom Edge)
**Rating:** 1/10
**Quote:** "To be quite frank, this is, in my opinion, the **worse class in the entire game**."
**Critical Issue:** "By time it gets halfway toward enemy, battle would have long been over"
**Recommendation:** "Never use this class path."

### Syonyx
**Rating:** Worst tier
**Focus:** Heavy armor, very slow
**Strengths:** Strong against archers (if they could reach them)
**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to magic, **catastrophically low movement**
**Recommendation:** Avoid completely

### All FAQ Authors
**Consensus:** **NEVER MAKE ARMOR**
**Unanimous:** Worst class in game
**Agreement:** 2-tile movement is unrecoverable flaw

---

## Final Verdict

{: .label .label-red }
**NEVER USE THIS CLASS**

**Why Armor is 1/10:**
- **2-tile movement = never reaches combat**
- High stats = useless (never gets to use them)
- Low MAG DEF = dies to enemy mages
- Takes experience from useful characters
- Essentially playing with 11 characters instead of 12

**The Fundamental Flaw:**
- Movement is everything in strategy games
- Armor has worst movement (2 tiles)
- **Unusable regardless of other stats**

**What To Do Instead:**
- **Choose Knight at Level 10** (6/10, vastly superior)
- Knights have 3-4 tile movement (normal)
- Knights reach combat (actually contribute)
- Knights are serviceable frontline units

{: .danger }
> **If you make Armor, you are voluntarily choosing to handicap yourself.** There is NO scenario where Armor is better than Knight!

---

## The "Never Armor" Commitment

### At Level 10, You Choose

**When Clint/Grog/Dolan reach Level 10:**

**Option A: Swordsman (Knight path)**
- Rating: 6/10
- Serviceable frontline fighter
- Normal movement (3-4 tiles)
- Contributes to battles
- **CHOOSE THIS**

**Option B: Guardsman (Armor path)**
- Rating: 1/10
- Worst class in game
- Crippled movement (2 tiles)
- Never contributes
- **NEVER CHOOSE THIS**

{: .important }
> **The choice is obvious:** Knight (6/10) >> Armor (1/10). Always choose Knight. Always.

## Next Steps

- **DO:** Make all Soldiers into Knights (Swordsman → Duelist)
- **DON'T:** Ever make Armor (Guardsman → Dragoon)
- Review [Knight Class Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/job-classes/knight/) for proper frontline class (6/10)
- Review [Job Classes Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/job-classes/) for optimal party composition

## Epilogue: Why Does This Class Exist?

### Game Design Perspective

**Theory:**
- Developers wanted "tank" archetype
- High DEF + low MOVE = defensive specialist
- Intended for defensive playstyles?

**Reality:**
- Vandal Hearts battles are offensive (attack enemy)
- Maps require reaching enemy position
- Defensive specialist doesn't fit game design
- **Class doesn't match game's structure**

**Lesson:**
- Stats don't matter if can't participate
- Movement > everything else
- **Armor is proof that mobility is king**

{: .note }
> Armor class is unintentional proof that **movement is the most important stat in strategy games**. No amount of ATK/DEF compensates for inability to reach combat.
