## Overview

{: .important }
> "With the sole exception of the Vandalier, this is far and wide, the strongest class in the entire game." - Jeff Chan

The **Mage class** is universally rated 10/10 by FAQ authors - the highest possible rating. Once your Mages learn **Phase Shift**, all other characters become essentially obsolete for dealing damage. Mages are so powerful that battles often end before your other characters can even reach combat.

## Class Progression

```
Level 1-9          Level 10-19        Level 20+
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Mage ──────────> Sorcerer ──────────> Enchanter
```

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Class | Key Spells Gained |
|:------|:------|:------------------|
| 1-9 | **Mage** | Dark Star (AOE), Blast, elemental spells |
| 10-19 | **Sorcerer** | **Phase Shift** (game-changing!), Roman Fire, Meteor |
| 20+ | **Enchanter** | **Salamander** (ultimate fire AOE) |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** NEVER choose the Monk path at Level 10! Always go Sorcerer → Enchanter!

---

## Available Characters

| Character | Starting Level | When Joins |
|:----------|:--------------|:-----------|
| **Eleni Dunbar** | 7 | Chapter 1, Section 3 |
| **Zohar Abu Sa'id** | 14 | Chapter 3, Section 1 |

{: .note }
> Both should ALWAYS go pure Mage path. Dual mages (Eleni + Zohar) create an unstoppable combination!

## Statistics

### Stat Distribution

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|:-----|:-------|:------|
| **ATK** | Low | Irrelevant - never use physical attacks |
| **DEF** | Low | Irrelevant - enemies die before reaching you |
| **AGL** | High | Good evasion |
| **MAG DEF** | Very High | Excellent magic resistance |
| **MOVE** | Average | Standard movement |

{: .important }
> "Forget that Mage characters don't take damage well. Forget that physical attack is laughable. **It does not matter.**" - Jeff Chan

## Why Mage is 10/10

### The Phase Shift Revolution

{: .warning }
> **Game-Changing Moment:** As soon as Phase Shift becomes available (~Level 12-14), the game fundamentally changes.

**Phase Shift Impact:**
- Hits **3x3 to 4x4 area** (5-6 enemies simultaneously!)
- **Massive damage** (50-100+ HP per enemy)
- **Extreme range** (can hit from safe distance)
- **No counterattack** (spell from far away)
- **Low MP cost** relative to damage output

**What This Means:**
- One Phase Shift can eliminate entire enemy groups
- Two Mages casting = entire army deleted
- Other characters never reach combat
- Battles end in 3-5 rounds instead of 15-20

### The Salamander Devastation

**Ultimate Spell (Level 20+):**
- Even more powerful than Phase Shift
- Fire elemental AOE
- Can solo groups of golems
- Essential for Trials
- Boss-killer spell

### Range Superiority

**Spell Range:**
- 4-6 tile range (Phase Shift, Salamander)
- Can attack from complete safety
- Enemies die before closing distance
- Protect mages = they win battles

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Why Stats Don't Matter

**Jeff Chan's Insight:**
> "Zohar and Eleni will essentially be walking death machines. Anything that gets close dies."

**Conventional Wisdom Says:**
- Low DEF = vulnerable
- Low ATK = weak damage
- Must protect fragile units

**Reality:**
- Enemies never reach them (killed by spells)
- Physical attack irrelevant (use spells)
- Protection = keeping them in back (easy)

---

### Battle Impact

**Typical Scenario:**
1. **Round 1:** Mages cast Phase Shift on enemy clusters
2. **Round 2:** 4-6 enemies dead or critically wounded
3. **Round 3:** Second Phase Shift eliminates another group
4. **Round 4-5:** Battle over

**Your Other Characters:**
- Knights still walking toward enemies
- Archers get 1-2 shots
- Healers barely needed
- **Mages already won**

{: .note }
> "Spells like Phase Shift and Salamander end battle so quickly, other characters may never get chance to get into fray." - Jeff Chan

---

## Weaknesses & Counters

### Only Weakness: Other Mages

**Enemy Mages:**
- Have high Magic Defense (like your Mages)
- Take less damage from spells
- Can actually survive Phase Shift
- Most dangerous enemy type

**Solution:**
- Use Archers to snipe enemy Mages
- Use Airmen to rush them
- Focus-fire with multiple units
- Kill enemy Mages FIRST (always priority #1)

### Physical Vulnerability

**If Enemies Reach Mages:**
- Low physical defense
- Can die in 2-3 hits
- Problematic if surrounded

**Prevention:**
- Position mages in back
- Frontline fighters protect them
- Use terrain (elevated positions)
- Kill enemies before they close distance (usual outcome)

## Optimal Spell Usage

### Essential Spells

**Priority Spells to Learn:**

| Level | Spell | Type | Priority | Notes |
|:------|:------|:-----|:---------|:------|
| ~5 | **Dark Star** | AOE | HIGH | First area spell |
| ~12 | **Phase Shift** | AOE | CRITICAL | Game-changer! |
| ~15 | **Roman Fire** | AOE Fire | MEDIUM | Elemental option |
| ~18 | **Meteor** | Single | MEDIUM | Boss killer |
| ~22 | **Salamander** | AOE Fire | CRITICAL | Ultimate spell |

### Spell Priority Guide

**Against Groups of Enemies:**
1. **Phase Shift** - Always first choice
2. **Salamander** - When available (Level 20+)
3. **Dark Star** - Early game alternative

**Against Single Targets (Bosses):**
1. **Meteor** - Highest single-target damage
2. **Focused elemental** - Exploit weaknesses
3. **Phase Shift** - Still good even vs. 1 enemy

**Against Golems:**
1. **Salamander** - Golems weak to fire
2. **Phase Shift** - Still effective
3. Physical attacks worthless (high DEF)

## Party Composition

### The Dual Mage Strategy

{: .important }
> **BOTH Eleni AND Zohar should be Enchanters!** This is non-negotiable for optimal play.

**Why Two Mages:**
- **Turn 1:** Eleni Phase Shifts left side, Zohar Phase Shifts right side
- **Result:** Entire enemy formation devastated
- **Backup:** If one runs out of MP, other continues
- **Trials:** Essential for golem-heavy battles

**Recommended Formation:**
```
[Knight] [Ash] [Knight]
  [Eleni] [Healer] [Zohar]
   [Archer] [Archer] [Archer]

Mages in protected center position
Frontline shields them
Healers keep everyone alive
Archers support
```

| Ch. 3-4 | Spirit Staff | +15 | 2000G |

## MP Management

### The MP Problem

**Challenge:**
- Powerful spells cost significant MP
- Phase Shift: ~15-20 MP per cast
- Salamander: ~20-25 MP per cast
- Can run out mid-battle

**Solutions:**

**1. Mage Gems**
- Restore MP during battle
- Stock 10-20 for important battles
- Essential for Trials

**2. Elixirs**
- Full HP/MP restore
- Emergency backup
- Expensive but worth it

**3. Conservative Casting**
- Don't waste Phase Shift on weak enemies
- Use Dark Star on fodder
- Save big spells for tough foes

**4. Dual Mage Rotation**
- Eleni casts while Zohar conserves
- Alternate to manage MP pools
- One always has MP available

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Going Monk Path
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Why It's Terrible:**
- Dilutes pure magical power
- Hybrid healing/offense excels at neither
- Wastes highest-rated class (10/10)
- Cannot undo decision

{: .danger }
> **NEVER go Monk!** Always Sorcerer → Enchanter!

### Mistake #2: Exposing Mages
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Common Error:**
- Moving mages to frontline
- Leaving them unprotected
- Positioning where enemies can reach

**Why It Fails:**
- Low physical defense
- Die quickly if surrounded
- Losing mage often = game over

**Solution:**
- Always keep mages in back
- Fighters screen them
- Use range advantage

### Mistake #3: Using Physical Attacks
{: .label .label-yellow }
**INEFFICIENT!**

**Temptation:**
- "Save MP, use staff to hit"
- Physical attack to conserve spells

**Why It's Bad:**
- Pitiful damage (5-10 HP maybe)
- Wastes turn
- Exposes mage to counterattack
- Defeats purpose of Mage class

**Solution:**
- **Always cast spells**
- Stock MP items
- That's what Mages do!

---

## Advanced Tactics

### Elevation Advantage
- Position mages on high ground
- Increased spell range
- Line of sight bonuses
- Natural protection

### Terrain Usage
- Use walls/obstacles for cover
- Enemy can't reach = can't hit
- Choke points funnel enemies
- Spells hit chokepoint = mass death

### Target Priority
1. **Enemy Mages** - Kill first (biggest threat)
2. **Clustered Groups** - Maximum Phase Shift value
3. **Dangerous Bosses** - Before they act
4. **Golems** - Only magic works well

### Spell Timing
- **Round 1:** Usually wait (let enemies cluster)
- **Round 2-3:** Phase Shift when 4+ enemies grouped
- **Save some MP:** Don't blow entire load early
- **Boss Rounds:** Meteor/Salamander for big damage

---

## Boss Battle Strategy

### Standard Boss Approach
1. **Clear minions first** with Phase Shift
2. **Focus boss** with Meteor
3. **Repeat** until boss dies
4. Healers keep party alive
5. Physical characters support

### Multi-Boss Battles
- Use **Salamander** on groups of bosses
- Can hit 2-3 bosses simultaneously
- Massive damage to all
- Combined with physical attacks = quick kills

---

## Trial of Toroah Performance

### Why Mages Dominate Trials

**Chaos Trial (All Golems):**
- Golems have extremely high physical DEF
- Physical attacks do ~5-10 damage
- Phase Shift does ~60-80 damage
- **Mages essential** for golem Trials

**Logos Trial (27 Enemies):**
- Long spiral staircase
- Would take forever with physical
- Phase Shift clears groups quickly
- Salamander ends clusters

**Heaven Trial (Boss Rush):**
- 28 elite enemies
- Need massive AOE damage
- Dual mages = clear path through
- Physical characters can't keep up

{: .important }
> **Trials are designed for Mages.** Attempting without them is masochistic.

---

## Leveling Strategy

### Eleni (Joins Level 7)
- **Ch. 1-2:** Use extensively, advance to Sorcerer at 10
- **Ch. 2-3:** Learn Phase Shift, become death machine
- **Ch. 4-5:** Advance to Enchanter at 20
- **Ch. 5-6:** Learn Salamander, unstoppable

### Zohar (Joins Level 14)
- **Ch. 3:** Immediately useful, already Sorcerer
- **Ch. 3-4:** Already has Phase Shift!
- **Ch. 4-5:** Advance to Enchanter at 20
- **Ch. 5-6:** Dual Enchanters = victory

{: .note }
> Zohar joins already powerful (Level 14 Sorcerer). Immediate impact!
