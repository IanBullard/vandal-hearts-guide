## Overview

{: .important }
> "One of the best classes in game. Staple healers - in game where you cannot revive characters that have fallen during battle, this becomes exceedingly important." - Jeff Chan

The **Priest class** is universally rated 9/10 by FAQ authors - the second-highest possible rating. In a game where fallen characters **cannot be revived during battle**, Priests become absolutely essential. Without strong healing, your party simply cannot survive the increasingly difficult battles.

## Class Progression

```
Level 1-9          Level 10-19        Level 20+
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Healer ──────────> Bishop ──────────> Archbishop
```

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Class | Key Spells Gained |
|:------|:------|:------------------|
| 1-9 | **Healer** | Healing, Mystic Shield, Cure |
| 10-19 | **Bishop** | Healing Plus, Bless Weapon, Holy Lightning, Ultra Healing |
| 20+ | **Archbishop** | **Supreme Healing** (infinite range party heal!) |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** NEVER choose the Monk path at Level 10! Always go Bishop → Archbishop!

---

## Available Characters

| Character | Starting Level | When Joins |
|:----------|:--------------|:-----------|
| **Huxley Hobbes** | 7 | Chapter 1, Section 3 |
| **Sara** | 9 | Chapter 2, Section 2 |

{: .note }
> Both should ALWAYS go pure Priest path. Dual healers create nearly unstoppable survivability!

---

## Statistics

### Stat Distribution

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|:-----|:-------|:------|
| **ATK** | Low | Irrelevant - never use physical attacks |
| **DEF** | Low | Must keep protected behind front lines |
| **AGL** | High | Good evasion helps survival |
| **MAG DEF** | Very High | Excellent protection from enemy mages |
| **MOVE** | Average | Standard movement |

{: .important }
> "Even though don't take damage very well, can utilize range provided by spells and stay behind other characters." - Jeff Chan

## Why Priest is 9/10

### The Healing Imperative

{: .warning }
> **Critical Game Mechanic:** Characters who fall in battle **CANNOT be revived until battle ends**. If they fall, they're gone for the entire fight!

**This Changes Everything:**
- No phoenix downs during combat
- No revival spells mid-battle
- Dead = gone until you win
- **Prevention is the only option**
- **Priests are your only defense against defeat**

**What This Means:**
- Must keep entire party alive through healing
- Losing characters = dramatic tactical disadvantage
- Priests become absolutely essential
- Cannot win difficult battles without strong healing
- Huxley and/or Sara are **mandatory party members**

### The Supreme Healing Revolution

**Ultimate Spell (Level 20+):**
- **Infinite range** - Can cast from anywhere
- **Infinite field** - Hits entire party simultaneously
- Full HP restoration for everyone
- Game-changing capability
- Essential for Trials and boss battles
- Makes impossible battles winnable

{: .note }
> Supreme Healing costs 30 MP but can save your entire party from the brink of defeat in one cast!

### Versatile Spell Arsenal

**Priests Don't Just Heal:**
- **Support Buffs:** Mystic Shield (defense), Bless Weapon (attack)
- **Offensive Magic:** Holy Lightning, Holy Pressure
- **Status Cures:** Cure (remove poison, paralysis)
- **MP Restoration:** Magic Charge (restore ally MP)
- **Range Advantage:** Can cast from 4-5 tiles away

**Complete Package:**
- Primary role: Keep party alive
- Secondary role: Buff allies for more damage
- Tertiary role: Attack enemies when needed
- Utility role: Cure status ailments

---

## Strategic Analysis

### Why You MUST Have Priests

**Jeff Chan's Assessment:**
> "In game where you cannot revive characters that have fallen during battle, this becomes exceedingly important."

**The Math is Simple:**
- Battles last 10-20 rounds
- Enemies deal 20-50 damage per hit
- Characters have 80-200 HP
- **Without healing:** Party dies around round 5-10
- **With healing:** Party survives to victory

**No Viable Alternative:**
- Herbs restore ~30 HP (not enough)
- Megaherbs restore ~60 HP (still insufficient)
- Items take character action (inefficient)
- Items run out (not sustainable)
- **Only Priests provide reliable healing**

### Positioning Strategy

**The Protected Core:**
```
[Knight] [Ash] [Knight]
  [Huxley] [Eleni] [Sara]
   [Archer] [Archer] [Archer]

Priests in protected center!
Front line absorbs damage
Priests heal from safety
```

**Why This Works:**
- Priests have low physical defense
- But spells have 4-5 tile range
- Can heal from behind front lines
- **Never need to enter danger zone**
- Enemy must break through knights first
- By then, enemies already dead (thanks to Mages)

{: .important }
> "Quite easy to hide Priests to point where they never even see front lines (except rare instances where it's funny to watch Huxley take his cane and throw down)." - Jeff Chan

---

## Battle Impact

### Typical Healing Cycle

**Early Battle (Rounds 1-5):**
1. **Mystic Shield** on front-line fighters (preemptive)
2. **Bless Weapon** on main attackers (boost damage)
3. **Healing** on anyone taking damage
4. Position to maintain safe distance

**Mid Battle (Rounds 6-12):**
1. **Healing Plus** on wounded clusters (AOE healing)
2. **Ultra Healing** on multiple injured allies
3. **Cure** on poisoned/paralyzed characters
4. **Magic Charge** if mages running low on MP

**Late Battle (Rounds 13+):**
1. **Supreme Healing** for full party restore
2. Continue spot healing as needed
3. **Holy Lightning** to finish weakened enemies
4. Conserve MP for next battle

### Your Other Characters Rely on Priests

**Knights and Soldiers:**
- Take heavy physical damage
- Need constant healing to survive
- Mystic Shield reduces incoming damage

**Mages:**
- Low physical defense
- If caught by enemy, need emergency healing
- Priests keep them alive to cast spells

**Archers and Airmen:**
- Medium durability
- Occasional healing keeps them effective
- Bless Weapon boosts their damage output

**Everyone:**
- Status effects must be cured immediately
- Supreme Healing saves party from TPK
- **Without Priests, entire strategy collapses**

---

## Weaknesses & Counters

### Physical Vulnerability

**If Enemies Reach Priests:**
- Low physical defense
- Can die in 3-4 hits from strong enemies
- Knights take 10-15 damage; Priests take 40-50
- Very dangerous if surrounded

**Prevention:**
- Position priests in back
- Front-line fighters protect them
- Use terrain (elevated positions)
- Kill enemies before they reach priests (Mage support)
- **Losing healer often means game over**

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL:** Protect your Priests at all costs! If Huxley or Sara falls, the entire party is in grave danger!

### MP Management Challenge

**The MP Problem:**
- Healing spells cost MP
- Healing (3 MP), Healing Plus (4 MP)
- Ultra Healing (5 MP)
- **Supreme Healing (30 MP!)** - expensive!
- Long battles drain MP reserves
- Running out of MP = cannot heal = party wipes

**Solutions:**

**1. Mage Gems & Elixirs**
- Mage Gems restore 10 MP
- Elixirs restore full HP/MP
- Stock 10-15 for important battles
- Essential for Trials

**2. Magic Charge Spell**
- Costs 10 MP but restores 10 MP to ally
- Transfer MP from Priest to Mage
- Useful when mage running low
- Priests usually have better MP pools

**3. Conservative Healing**
- Don't overheal (wasted MP)
- Don't heal if damage is minor
- Use Healing (3 MP) instead of Ultra Healing (5 MP) when possible
- Save Supreme Healing for emergencies

**4. Dual Healer Rotation**
- Huxley heals while Sara conserves
- Alternate heavy healing turns
- One always has MP available
- Backup if one runs dry

## Optimal Spell Usage

### Essential Spells

**Priority Spells to Learn:**

| Level | Spell | Type | Cost | Priority | Notes |
|:------|:------|:-----|:-----|:---------|:------|
| Start | **Healing** | Heal | 3 MP | CRITICAL | Primary heal (R:4, single) |
| ~3 | **Mystic Shield** | Buff | 3 MP | CRITICAL | Defense boost |
| ~4 | **Cure** | Status | 2 MP | HIGH | Remove ailments |
| ~10 | **Healing Plus** | Heal | 4 MP | HIGH | AOE heal (R:4, F:1) |
| ~12 | **Bless Weapon** | Buff | 3 MP | MEDIUM | Attack boost |
| ~14 | **Holy Lightning** | Attack | 7 MP | MEDIUM | Offensive option |
| ~16 | **Ultra Healing** | Heal | 5 MP | HIGH | Stronger AOE (R:5, F:2) |
| ~18 | **Magic Charge** | Utility | 10 MP | LOW | MP transfer |
| ~22 | **Supreme Healing** | Heal | 30 MP | CRITICAL | Ultimate full party heal! |

### Spell Priority Guide

**Healing Priority (In Combat):**
1. **Healing / Healing Plus** - Routine HP restoration
2. **Ultra Healing** - Multiple wounded allies
3. **Supreme Healing** - Emergency full party restore
4. Use items (Herbs, Megaherbs) when MP conservation needed

**Support Priority:**
1. **Mystic Shield** - Cast on front-line fighters before engagement
2. **Bless Weapon** - Cast on primary damage dealers (Ash, Knights)
3. **Cure** - Remove status effects immediately
4. **Magic Charge** - Only when mages critically low on MP

**Offensive Priority (When Needed):**
1. **Holy Lightning** - Finish weakened enemies
2. **Holy Pressure** - AOE damage (rare use)
3. Generally better to heal than attack (leave offense to Mages)

## Party Composition

### The Dual Healer Strategy

{: .important }
> **BOTH Huxley AND Sara should be Archbishops!** This creates nearly unstoppable survivability.

**Why Two Priests:**
- **Redundancy:** If one falls, other continues healing
- **MP Pool:** Combined MP = sustained healing
- **Coverage:** One heals front, one heals back
- **Buffs:** Both can cast Mystic Shield on different units
- **Trials:** Essential for surviving long battles

**Formation with Dual Priests:**
```
[Clint] [Ash] [Grog]
  [Huxley] [Eleni] [Sara]
   [Diego] [Kira] [Zohar]

Two healers provide overlapping coverage
Entire party stays in healing range
Maximum survivability
```

### The Core Trinity

**Every Party Needs:**
1. **Mage** (Eleni/Zohar) - Damage dealers
2. **Priest** (Huxley/Sara) - Keep party alive
3. **Fighter** (Ash/Knights) - Front line

**Why This Works:**
- Mages eliminate enemies quickly
- Fighters absorb/block damage
- Priests keep everyone healthy
- **Synergy creates unstoppable team**

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Going Monk Path
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Why It's Terrible:**
- Hybrid healing/offense excels at neither
- Healing never matches pure Priest
- Offense never matches pure Mage
- Wastes second-best class (9/10)
- Cannot undo decision

{: .danger }
> **NEVER go Monk!** Always Bishop → Archbishop!

**The Math:**
- Monk healing: Moderate
- Archbishop healing: Supreme Healing (infinite range/field!)
- Monk offense: Moderate magic
- Mage offense: Phase Shift, Salamander (devastating!)
- **Why have mediocre healing AND mediocre offense when you can have SUPREME healing?**

### Mistake #2: Exposing Priests
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Common Error:**
- Moving priests to front line
- Leaving them unprotected
- Positioning where enemies can reach
- "I'll just heal after taking damage"

**Why It Fails:**
- Low physical defense
- Die quickly if targeted (3-4 hits)
- If priest dies, party often follows
- **Prevention better than cure!**

**Solution:**
- Always keep priests in back
- Fighters screen them
- Use range advantage (4-5 tiles)
- Elevated terrain provides extra safety

### Mistake #3: Overhealing
{: .label .label-yellow }
**INEFFICIENT!**

**Temptation:**
- "Character took 15 damage, better heal to full"
- Constant healing even minor damage
- Using Ultra Healing on single target
- Burning MP unnecessarily

**Why It's Bad:**
- Wastes MP on minor injuries
- MP reserves depleted for emergencies
- Run out of MP mid-battle
- Cannot cast Supreme Healing when needed

**Solution:**
- **Triage:** Heal critical injuries first
- Use items (Herbs) for minor damage
- Match spell to situation (Healing vs Ultra Healing)
- Save MP for emergencies

### Mistake #4: Neglecting Buffs
{: .label .label-yellow }
**SUBOPTIMAL!**

**Common Pattern:**
- Only casting healing spells
- Forgetting Mystic Shield exists
- Ignoring Bless Weapon
- "Healing is the only priority"

**Why It's Wasteful:**
- Mystic Shield reduces damage taken (preemptive)
- Less damage = less healing needed = MP saved
- Bless Weapon boosts ally damage (end battles faster)
- **Prevention reduces need for healing!**

**Solution:**
- **Round 1:** Mystic Shield on front-line units
- **Round 2:** Bless Weapon on main attackers
- **Round 3+:** Heal as needed
- Think proactively, not reactively

---

## Advanced Tactics

### Preemptive Shielding
- Cast Mystic Shield **before** enemies reach your fighters
- Reduces incoming damage by ~25-35%
- Less damage = less healing required
- MP efficiency multiplied

### Healing Priorities
**Triage Rules:**
1. **Critical (below 30% HP):** Heal immediately
2. **Wounded (30-60% HP):** Heal when convenient
3. **Scratched (60-90% HP):** Low priority
4. **Full HP:** Don't heal (wasted MP)

### MP Conservation Techniques
- Use Healing (3 MP) on single targets
- Use Healing Plus (4 MP) on 2-3 clustered allies
- Use Ultra Healing (5 MP) on 3-4 clustered allies
- Use Supreme Healing (30 MP) ONLY for emergencies

### Positioning Mastery
- **High ground:** Elevated positions provide safety + range
- **Walls/obstacles:** Enemy cannot path to you easily
- **Corner positions:** Cannot be surrounded
- **Center formation:** Equal distance to all allies

---

## Boss Battle Strategy

### Standard Boss Approach
1. **Pre-battle:** Supreme Healing to enter at full HP
2. **Round 1:** Mystic Shield on front-line units
3. **Round 2:** Bless Weapon on main attackers
4. **Round 3+:** Heal as boss damages party
5. **Emergency:** Supreme Healing if multiple allies critical
6. **Repeat** until boss defeated

### Multi-Phase Bosses
- **Conserve MP** for later phases
- Use Healing (3 MP) instead of Ultra Healing (5 MP)
- Save Supreme Healing (30 MP) for crisis moments
- Stock Mage Gems for MP restoration

### Boss Special Attacks
**When Boss Charges Big Attack:**
1. **Before attack:** Mystic Shield on likely targets
2. **After attack:** Supreme Healing to restore party
3. This two-spell combo negates boss strategy
4. Boss wastes turn, you recover instantly

## Trial of Toroah Performance

### Why Priests Dominate Trials

**All Trials:**
- Long battles (20-30+ rounds)
- Heavy sustained damage
- No ability to retreat/rest
- **Cannot win without strong healing**

**Chaos Trial (All Golems):**
- Golems deal heavy physical damage
- Knights take constant punishment
- Priests must keep them alive
- Supreme Healing essential

**Logos Trial (27 Enemies):**
- Attrition battle
- Damage accumulates over rounds
- Must heal constantly
- MP management critical

**Heaven Trial (Boss Rush):**
- 28 elite enemies
- Multiple tough battles
- Healing sustains party through gauntlet
- **Priests are survival requirement**

{: .important }
> **Trials are impossible without strong Priests.** Stock 15-20 Mage Gems before attempting!

---

## Leveling Strategy

### Huxley (Joins Level 7)
- **Ch. 1-2:** Use extensively, advance to Bishop at 10
- **Ch. 2-3:** Learn healing spell arsenal
- **Ch. 4-5:** Advance to Archbishop at 20
- **Ch. 5-6:** Learn Supreme Healing, unstoppable support

### Sara (Joins Level 9)
- **Ch. 2-3:** Secondary healer, advance to Bishop at 10
- **Ch. 3-4:** Supports Huxley with healing
- **Ch. 4-5:** Advance to Archbishop at 20
- **Ch. 5-6:** Dual Archbishops = maximum survivability

{: .note }
> Sara joins just before Bishop advancement (Lv.9). Quick promotion to Bishop at Lv.10!

---

## Final Verdict

{: .label .label-green }
**MANDATORY CLASS**

**You MUST have Priests to win:**
- Essential for party survival
- No in-battle revival = must prevent deaths
- Supreme Healing changes difficult battles
- Cannot complete game without strong healing

**Both Huxley AND Sara should be Archbishops**
- Not a suggestion
- Not optional
- **Required for optimal play**
- Dual healers = unstoppable survivability

{: .note }

## Healing Spell Comparison

### Single-Target Healing
- **Healing** (3 MP, R:4) - Basic, efficient
- **Healing Plus** (4 MP, R:4, F:1) - AOE option
- **Ultra Healing** (5 MP, R:5, F:2) - Stronger AOE
- **Supreme Healing** (30 MP, infinite) - Ultimate

### When to Use Each
- **Healing:** Single wounded ally, MP conservation
- **Healing Plus:** 2-3 clustered allies moderately wounded
- **Ultra Healing:** 3-4 clustered allies heavily wounded
- **Supreme Healing:** Entire party critical, emergency only

### MP Efficiency
- **Best:** Healing (3 MP per target)
- **Good:** Healing Plus (4 MP / 2-3 targets = ~1.5 MP each)
- **Fair:** Ultra Healing (5 MP / 3-4 targets = ~1.5 MP each)
- **Emergency:** Supreme Healing (30 MP, but saves entire party)

---

## Comparison: Priest vs Monk

**Why Priest Wins:**

| Aspect | Priest (9/10) | Monk (5/10) |
|:-------|:-------------|:------------|
| **Healing Power** | Supreme Healing (infinite range/field) | Healing Wave (limited range) |
| **Support Spells** | Mystic Shield, Bless Weapon, Cure | Perfect Guard (expensive 15 MP) |
| **MP Efficiency** | Excellent (3-5 MP heals) | Poor (10-15 MP spells) |
| **Role Focus** | Pure healer (excels at it) | Hybrid (mediocre at both) |
| **Party Need** | Essential (cannot win without) | Optional (Priest + Mage better) |

{: .danger }
> **The Fatal Flaw of Monk:** To get Monk, you must sacrifice either Mage (10/10) or Priest (9/10). Both are better than Monk (5/10). Never worth it!
