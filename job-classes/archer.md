## Overview

{: .important }
> "Though don't deal massive damage like other classes, Archers amongst the best. Can deal damage from long range that, if used correctly, amounts to attacks without getting countered." - Jeff Chan

The **Archer class** is rated 8/10 by FAQ authors - tied for third-best in the game. Archers excel through **tactical positioning** and **risk-free damage**, not raw power. Their ability to attack from 4-6 tiles away without counterattack makes them invaluable for softening enemies and eliminating high-priority targets.

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Class | Key Improvements |
|:------|:------|:-----------------|
| 1-9 | **Archer** | Basic ranged attacks, 4-tile range |
| 10-19 | **Bowman** | Improved stats, better equipment access |
| 20+ | **Sniper** | Maximum range, highest accuracy |

{: .note }
> **Alternative Path:** At Level 10, can become **Hawknight** instead (Airman path, rated 7/10). Both paths viable - covered in separate guide.

## Statistics

### Stat Distribution

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|:-----|:-------|:------|
| **ATK** | Average | Decent damage, not exceptional |
| **DEF** | Low | Vulnerable to melee, must stay back |
| **AGL** | Average | Moderate evasion |

| **MOVE** | Average | Standard movement (3-4 tiles) |

**Special Ability:** Attacks from distance (4-6 tile range)

**Strengths:** Strong against Airmen (bonus damage)

**Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to Knights and Armor

{: .important }
> Low DEF doesn't matter if enemies never reach you. **Range is your defense!**

## Why Archer is 8/10

### The "Free Damage" Strategy

{: .warning }
> **Core Tactic:** Archers attack BEFORE melee characters engage. This creates "free damage" with no risk.

**How It Works:**
1. Enemy at full HP (80 HP)
2. **Archer shoots** for 25 damage (now 55 HP)
3. Knight attacks for 55 damage (enemy dies)
4. **Knight takes ZERO counterattack damage**
5. Net result: Enemy killed, party unharmed

**Without Archer:**
1. Enemy at full HP (80 HP)
2. Knight attacks for 55 damage (55 HP remains)
3. **Enemy counterattacks for 30 damage** (Knight takes damage)
4. Knight must attack again (takes another counterattack)
5. Net result: Enemy killed, Knight took 60 damage

**The Math:**
- **With Archer:** 0 damage taken
- **Without Archer:** 60 damage taken
- **Difference:** Archer essentially "prevented" 60 damage
- **Multiply by 20 enemies:** Archers save hundreds of HP over battle

{: .note }
> "If used correctly, amounts to attacking without getting countered." - Jeff Chan

### Range Superiority

**Archer Range:** 4-6 tiles
**Enemy Melee Range:** 1-2 tiles

**Strategic Advantage:**
- Can attack from complete safety
- Enemy cannot retaliate
- No counterattack risk
- **Only class besides Mages with this advantage**

**Typical Scenario:**
```
Terrain Map:
[Archer] ← 5 tiles → [Enemy Knight]
Archer shoots → Enemy takes damage
Enemy cannot reach Archer
Archer shoots again next turn
Enemy still cannot reach
Archer gets 2-3 free attacks before enemy closes

Compare to:
[Knight] ← 2 tiles → [Enemy Knight]
Knight attacks → Enemy counterattacks
Both take damage
```

### Priority Target Elimination

{: .important }
> "Can take out Airmen quickly and without hassle. Can take out Mage class enemies quickly. **Both will likely be most dangerous enemies you face.**" - Jeff Chan

**Enemy Threat Hierarchy:**
1. **Enemy Mages** - Phase Shift wipes your party
2. **Enemy Airmen** - High mobility, bypass front line
3. **Enemy Knights** - Strong but manageable
4. **Enemy Armor** - Slow, easy to avoid

**Archer Solution:**
- **vs Enemy Mages:** Archers deal full damage (Mages have low DEF)
- **vs Enemy Airmen:** Archers deal **bonus damage** (type advantage)
- Result: Eliminate biggest threats quickly and safely
- **Your Knights can't do this** - can't reach flying units easily
- **Your Mages could do this** - but Mages busy killing everything else

**Tactical Flow:**
1. **Round 1:** Archers eliminate enemy Mages/Airmen
2. **Round 2:** Mages cast Phase Shift on enemy clusters
3. **Round 3:** Knights mop up survivors
4. **Result:** Controlled, safe battle

## Strategic Analysis

### The Four-Archer Advantage

**Most Characters of Any Class:**
- Diego (joins Ch.1)
- Kira (joins Ch.2)
- Amon (joins Ch.2)
- Darius (joins Ch.3)

**Flexibility Options:**
- **Make all 4 Snipers** - Maximum ranged firepower
- **Make 3 Snipers + 1 Hawknight** - Mix of ground + air
- **Make 2 Snipers + 2 Hawknights** - Balanced approach
- **Make 1 Sniper + 3 Hawknights** - Maximum mobility (risky)

**Recommended:**
- **2-3 Snipers** (ground-based, safe, reliable)
- **1-2 Hawknights** (flying, mobile, but vulnerable to arrows)

### Positioning Mastery

**Optimal Archer Placement:**
```
Formation Example:
[Clint] [Ash] [Grog]
  [Huxley] [Eleni] [Sara]
   [Diego] [Kira] [Amon]

Archers in back row
Protected by front line
Can shoot over allies
Safe from enemy melee
```

**Elevation Advantage:**
- Archers on high ground get range bonus
- Can shoot farther
- Can see over obstacles
- Natural defensive position
- **Always seek high ground for archers**

### Combat Rhythm

**Ideal Turn Order:**
1. **Archers shoot first** (weaken enemies)
2. **Mages cast AOE** (damage clusters)
3. **Knights advance** (finish wounded enemies)
4. **Priests heal** (keep party healthy)

**Why This Order:**
- Archers soften targets before melee engages
- Mages eliminate groups before they act
- Knights clean up without taking counterattacks
- Priests have less healing to do (efficient)

---

## Tactical Applications

### Weakening Enemies

**The One-Hit Setup:**

Enemy HP: 80
- **Archer damage:** 25
- **After archer shot:** 55 HP
- **Knight damage:** 55
- **Result:** Knight one-shots enemy, no counterattack

**Without Archer:**
Enemy HP: 80
- **Knight damage:** 55
- **After first hit:** 25 HP (enemy counters for 30 damage)
- **Knight must hit again:** 55 damage (enemy counters again)
- **Result:** Enemy dead, Knight took 60 damage

**Scaling:**
- 10 enemies per battle
- 6 battles per chapter
- 6 chapters
- **360 prevented counterattacks**
- **~21,600 prevented damage over full game**
- Archers essentially "tank" thousands of damage by preventing it

### Focus Fire

**Concentrated Damage:**
- Multiple archers target same enemy
- 4 archers × 25 damage = 100 damage
- Can eliminate tough enemies in one round
- No risk to your party
- Especially effective vs enemy Mages

**Example:**
```
Enemy Mage (70 HP, low DEF)
→ Diego shoots: 25 damage
→ Kira shoots: 25 damage
→ Amon shoots: 25 damage
= 75 damage, Mage dead

Enemy never cast Phase Shift
Your party takes zero damage
Mage eliminated safely
```

### Kiting Strategy

**"Attack and Retreat":**
1. Archer shoots enemy
2. Enemy moves toward archer
3. **Archer retreats** (stay at max range)
4. Enemy chases
5. Archer shoots again
6. **Enemy never reaches archer**
7. Eventually enemy dies, archer untouched

**Practical Use:**
- Lure enemies away from groups
- Separate dangerous foes
- Control enemy movement
- Buy time for other characters

---

## Weaknesses & Counters

### Low Defense Vulnerability

**If Enemies Reach Archers:**
- Low physical defense
- Can die in 2-3 hits
- Knights deal 40-50 damage per hit
- Archers have 80-120 HP
- **Math: 2-3 hits = dead archer**

**Prevention:**
- Position archers in back
- Front-line units protect them
- Maintain distance (use full range)
- Retreat if enemies approach
- Use terrain (walls, elevation)

### Limited Melee Capability

**Close Combat:**
- Bow damage reduced at range 1
- Some bows cannot shoot adjacent targets
- Must retreat to be effective
- **Never let enemies close the gap**

### Enemy Archer Counters

**If Enemy Has Archers:**
- They can shoot your archers
- You shoot them, they shoot you
- Range advantage neutralized
- Becomes damage race

**Solution:**
- Prioritize killing enemy archers
- Use Mages (superior range + damage)
- Use Airmen (close gap quickly)
- Focus fire (eliminate them fast)

## Range Mechanics

### Understanding Range

**Range Formula:**
- **Light Bow:** 4 tiles
- **Iron Bow:** 5 tiles
- **Steel Bow:** 5 tiles
- **Great Bow:** 6 tiles
- **Rune Bow:** 6 tiles

**Practical Range:**
```
A = Archer
E = Enemy in range
. = Empty tile

. . . . . .
. . E E E .
. E E A E E
. E E E E .
. . E E E .
. . . . . .

6-tile range = massive coverage!
Can hit almost anywhere
```

### Elevation Bonus

**High Ground:**
- +1 range from elevated position
- Great Bow (6 range) becomes 7 range
- Can outrange enemy archers
- Natural defensive position

**Practical Use:**
- Always position archers on hills
- Towers and walls ideal
- Look for high ground in every battle
- **Range advantage = survival**

### Line of Sight

**Obstacles:**
- Cannot shoot through walls
- Cannot shoot through mountains
- **CAN shoot over allies** (important!)
- CAN shoot over low obstacles

**Formation Advantage:**
```
[Knight] [Knight] [Knight]
  ↓ Archer can shoot over them ↓
[Archer] [Archer] [Archer]

Front line doesn't block archers!
Perfect positioning
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Advancing Too Far
{: .label .label-red }
**DANGEROUS!**

**Common Error:**
- Moving archers toward enemy
- "I'll get closer for better shot"
- Exposing archers to melee range
- Positioning too aggressively

**Why It Fails:**
- Bows already have 4-6 tile range
- Don't need to be closer
- Moving forward = entering danger zone
- Enemies can reach you faster
- Low DEF = quick death

**Solution:**
- **Stay at maximum range**
- Let enemies come to you
- Shoot as they approach
- Retreat if they get close
- **Distance = safety**

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Priority Targets
{: .label .label-yellow }
**SUBOPTIMAL!**

**Common Pattern:**
- Shooting nearest enemy
- Attacking wounded enemies
- Ignoring enemy Mages/Airmen
- No target prioritization

**Why It's Bad:**
- Enemy Mage survives → casts Phase Shift → your party takes 80 damage each
- Enemy Airman survives → flies to back line → kills your Priest
- Wounded enemies → Priests can ignore them, focus elsewhere

**Solution:**
1. **Always kill enemy Mages first**
2. **Always kill enemy Airmen second**
3. Then focus on healthy melee units
4. Let Knights finish wounded enemies

### Mistake #3: Clumping Archers
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Temptation:**
- Positioning all archers together
- "Archer squad in back corner"
- Clustering for protection

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- Enemy Phase Shift hits all of them
- One AOE spell = all archers hurt
- If position overrun, all archers endangered
- No redundancy

**Solution:**
- **Spread archers across back line**
- 2-3 tiles between each archer
- Creates crossfire coverage
- AOE spells can't hit all of them
- One getting pressured ≠ all endangered

### Mistake #4: Going All Airmen
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Temptation:**
- "Flying is cool, make all 4 Hawknights!"
- Maximum mobility
- Ignore ground archer path

**Why It's Problematic:**
- **Airmen are weak to archers** (your main advantage lost)
- Enemy archers shred your airmen
- All 4 vulnerable to same enemy type
- No ground archer to counter enemy airmen

**Solution:**
- **Keep 2-3 ground Snipers**
- Make 1-2 Hawknights (flying support)
- Snipers counter enemy Airmen
- Hawknights provide mobility
- **Balanced approach = safer**

## Advanced Tactics

### The "Softening" Strategy

**Coordinated Attack:**
1. **Archers attack first** (reduce enemy HP by ~30%)
2. **Mages attack second** (AOE spells finish clusters)
3. **Knights charge third** (clean up survivors one-hit each)
4. **Result:** Battle ends quickly, minimal damage taken

### Focus Fire Protocols

**When to Focus Fire:**
- High-priority targets (Mages, Bosses)
- Tough enemies (high HP/DEF)
- Dangerous units that must die immediately

**How to Focus Fire:**
1. Identify target
2. All archers shoot same target
3. 4 archers × 25 damage = 100 damage
4. Most enemies die in one focus fire volley

### Kiting Technique

**Against Slow Enemies:**
1. Archer shoots
2. Enemy moves 3 tiles toward archer
3. Archer retreats 4 tiles
4. Net: Archer gained 1 tile distance
5. Archer shoots again
6. Repeat until enemy dead

**Practical Use:**
- Armor class enemies (slow, 2 move)
- Golems (slow, tough)
- Buy time for mages to position

### Overwatch Positioning

**Static Defense:**
- Archers on elevated position
- Covering approach routes
- Enemies must cross killzone
- Archers shoot as enemies approach
- **Enemies dead before reaching your lines**

---

## Boss Battle Strategy

### Standard Boss Approach

**Archer Role vs Bosses:**
1. **Chip damage** - Steady attacks every turn
2. **Priority adds** - Kill boss's supporting enemies
3. **Safe damage** - No risk, consistent output
4. Let Mages do heavy damage (more efficient)

**Typical Archer Turn vs Boss:**
- Shoot boss for 30-40 damage
- Not spectacular, but **reliable**
- Accumulates over 10-15 rounds
- 400-600 total damage from archers
- Helps bring down boss

### Multi-Enemy Bosses

**Some bosses have support:**
- Boss + 4-6 elite enemies
- Elite enemies often Mages or Airmen
- **Archer priority: Kill supporting Mages FIRST**
- Then focus on boss

**Why This Works:**
- Supporting enemies often more dangerous than boss
- Enemy Mages can wipe your party
- Eliminate threats, then handle boss safely
