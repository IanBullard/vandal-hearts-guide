## Overview

{: .important }
> "Ash's class is one of strongest in game. Ordinarily more powerful version of Knight class with motley assortment of spells at disposal." - Jeff Chan

The **Hero class** is Ash Lambert's unique class path - available only to the protagonist. Rated 8/10 for the standard progression, Hero becomes **10/10 as Vandalier** - tying with Mage as the strongest classes in the entire game.

---

## Class Progression

```
Level 5-9         Level 10-19       Level 20+         Special
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Hero ─────────> Champion ─────> Paragon ─────> Vandalier
                                                (requires all 6
                                                 Trials complete)
```

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Class | Key Improvements |
|:------|:------|:-----------------|
| 5-9 | **Hero** | Balanced stats, Faerie Light healing, Ice Storm attack |
| 10-19 | **Champion** | Stronger stats, Rolling Fire AOE, Faerie Star healing |
| 20+ | **Paragon** | Peak standard stats, Delta Mirage attack |
| Special | **Vandalier** | **EVERY SPELL IN GAME**, ultimate equipment, 10/10 power |

{: .warning }
> **CRITICAL:** Vandalier requires completing all six Trials of Toroah. Missing even one Trial means Ash cannot become Vandalier!

---

## Available Characters

| Character | Starting Level | Class |
|:----------|:--------------|:------|
| **Ash Lambert** | 5 | Hero (unique, protagonist) |

{: .note }
> Hero class is **exclusive to Ash**. No other character can become a Hero.

---

## Statistics

### Stat Distribution (Hero/Champion/Paragon)

| Stat | Rating | Notes |
|:-----|:-------|:------|
| **ATK** | High | "Matches any normal character's attacks hit for hit" |
| **DEF** | High | Strong defensive stats |
| **AGL** | Average | Moderate evasion |
| **MAG DEF** | Average | Normal magic resistance |
| **MOVE** | Average | Standard movement (3-4 tiles) |

**Special Ability:** Access to both physical attacks AND magic spells

**Hybrid Nature:** "More powerful version of Knight class" + spell arsenal

---

## Why Hero is 8/10 (Standard Path)

### The Hybrid Advantage

**Dual Capability:**
- **Physical Combat:** Matches Knight-class damage output
- **Magic Spells:** Attack and healing magic available
- **Anti-Armor:** Magic effective against high-DEF enemies
- **Self-Sufficient:** Can heal himself mid-battle

**Versatile Toolkit:**
- **vs Groups:** Rolling Fire (2/1 AOE), Delta Mirage
- **vs Single Target:** Sword attacks, Ice Storm
- **vs High-DEF:** Spells bypass physical armor
- **Emergency Healing:** Faerie Light, Faerie Star

{: .note }
> "Spells provide means to deal with Armor class characters, multi-enemy attacks, and healing." - Jeff Chan

### Better Than Knight

**Hero vs Knight Comparison:**

| Aspect | Hero (8/10) | Knight (6/10) |
|:-------|:------------|:--------------|
| **Physical Attack** | High (equal) | High |
| **Physical Defense** | High (equal) | High |
| **Magic Access** | YES (spells available) | NO (physical only) |
| **AOE Damage** | Rolling Fire, Delta Mirage | None |
| **Self-Healing** | Faerie Light, Faerie Star | None |
| **Anti-Armor** | Magic bypasses DEF | Struggles vs high-DEF |

**Verdict:** Hero does everything Knight does PLUS magic. Clear upgrade.

### Strategic Flexibility

**Ash Can Fill Multiple Roles:**
1. **Front-line fighter** (like Knight)
2. **Mid-range hybrid** (physical + magic)
3. **Emergency healer** (Faerie Light/Star)
4. **AOE damage** (Rolling Fire)
5. **Anti-armor specialist** (magic vs golems)

**No Other Class Has This Flexibility:**
- Knights: Physical only
- Mages: Magic only
- Priests: Support only
- **Hero: Physical AND magic**

## Strategic Analysis

### The Level Paradox

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL GAME MECHANIC:** Trials of Toroah enemy levels **scale based on Ash's level**. Higher Ash level = harder Trials!

**The Problem:**
- You want Ash strong for regular battles
- But Trials become harder if Ash is high level
- Trial enemies scale: Ash Lv.25 = enemies Lv.23-27
- Trial enemies at Ash Lv.15 = enemies Lv.13-17
- **10-level difference makes Trials drastically easier**

**The Meta Strategy:**
1. **Keep Ash as lowest-level character** (Lv.15-20)
2. Let other characters (Eleni, Zohar, Huxley) carry battles
3. Complete all 6 Trials while Ash is low-level (easier)
4. **Advance to Vandalier**
5. Ash explodes in power, can now power-level safely
6. Vandalier Ash dominates remaining game

**Why This Works:**
- Trials at low level = manageable challenge
- Trials at high level = nearly impossible
- After becoming Vandalier, level doesn't matter (already strongest)
- Better to struggle temporarily than fail Trials permanently

{: .note }
> "Many people use Ash as little as possible to make Trials easier. As result, Ash falls behind rest of party and sees very little use." - Jeff Chan

### The Game Over Risk

**Unique Weakness:**
- **If Ash falls in battle, it's instant Game Over**
- Doesn't matter if other 11 characters alive
- Ash dies = game ends
- Must restart battle from beginning

**Strategic Implications:**
1. **Protect Ash at all costs** - Position safely
2. **Never overextend** - Don't take unnecessary risks
3. **Emergency healing priority** - Heal Ash first
4. **Better to retreat** - Than risk Game Over

**Mitigation:**
- Position Ash in mid/back (not front line)
- Keep Priests nearby for emergency healing
- Use Ash's own Faerie Light/Star for self-heal
- Don't put Ash in range of enemy Mages

---

## Spell Usage Guide

### Hero Spells (Available Throughout)

| Spell | Type | R/F | Cost | Priority | Notes |
|:------|:-----|:----|:-----|:---------|:------|
| **Faerie Light** | Heal | 0/0 | 2 MP | MEDIUM | Self-heal only, emergency use |
| **Ice Storm** | Attack | 1/0 | 4 MP | MEDIUM | Single target magic damage |
| **Rolling Fire** | Attack | 2/1 | 8 MP | HIGH | AOE fire damage (3x3 area) |
| **Faerie Star** | Heal | 2/0 | 5 MP | MEDIUM | Heal nearby ally |
| **Delta Mirage** | Attack | 1/0 | 10 MP | MEDIUM | Strong single-target magic |

### As Hero/Champion/Paragon

**Standard Combat Rotation:**
1. **Rolling Fire** on enemy clusters (3+ enemies)
2. **Sword attacks** on single tough enemies
3. **Ice Storm** vs armored enemies (magic bypasses DEF)
4. **Faerie Light** emergency self-heal
5. **Delta Mirage** vs bosses (high damage)

**When to Use Each:**
- **Rolling Fire:** 3+ enemies grouped together
- **Ice Storm:** Single armored enemy (golem)
- **Delta Mirage:** Boss or elite enemy
- **Faerie Light:** Ash below 50% HP, no priest nearby
- **Faerie Star:** Ally near death, no priest nearby

### As Vandalier

**Priority Spell Usage:**

**1. Plasma Wave (15 MP) - THE GAME-CHANGER**
- Damages **every enemy on battlefield**
- 50-80 damage to all enemies simultaneously
- Use when 5+ enemies alive
- **Most cost-effective spell in game**
- Example: 8 enemies × 60 damage = 480 total damage for 15 MP!

**2. Phase Shift (12 MP) - AREA DEVASTATION**
- 0/7 field (huge area)
- 60-100 damage to 4-6 enemies
- Use when enemies clustered

**3. Salamander (14 MP) - ULTIMATE AOE**
- 0/10 field (massive area)
- Fire elemental
- Especially vs golems and armored

**4. Supreme Healing (30 MP) - PARTY SAVER**
- Infinite range/field
- Heals entire party to full
- Emergency use only (expensive)

**5. Life Orb Effect (0 MP!) - FREE FULL RESTORE**
- Restores ALL HP and MP
- **COSTS ZERO MP**
- Use every battle for free full restore!

{: .important }
> As Vandalier, open every battle with **Life Orb effect** (0 MP for full HP/MP restore), then spam **Plasma Wave** to damage all enemies. Game-breaking strategy!

## Leveling Strategy

### Pre-Trial Strategy (Chapters 1-5)

{: .warning }
> **Goal: Keep Ash LOW LEVEL (15-20) until all Trials complete!**

**How to Keep Ash Low:**
1. **Use Ash minimally** in battles
2. Let Eleni, Zohar, Diego do damage
3. **Position Ash safely in back** (out of combat)
4. Give kills to other characters, not Ash
5. Ash participates but doesn't kill (no exp from kills)

**Benefits:**
- Trials significantly easier (enemy levels lower)
- Higher success rate on Trials
- Other characters power up (carry battles)
- Less risk of Ash dying (back-line position safer)

### Trial Completion (Chapter 5-6)

**Complete in Order:**
1. **Nova Trial** (Ch. 3 onwards, hill assault)
2. **Earth Trial** (Ch. 3 onwards, all-archer battle)
3. **Mana Trial** (Ch. 4 onwards, mimic maze)
4. **Chaos Trial** (Ch. 4 onwards, golem+puzzle)
5. **Logos Trial** (Ch. 5 onwards, endurance climb)
6. **Heaven Trial** (Ch. 6 only, final boss rush)

{: .important }
> See [Trials of Toroah]({{ site.baseurl }}/trials/) section for detailed strategies for each trial.

### Post-Vandalier Strategy (Chapter 6)

**After Becoming Vandalier:**
1. **Now you can power-level Ash safely**
2. Vandalier is so strong, level barely matters
3. Plasma Wave + Life Orb = unstoppable
4. Ash can solo entire battles
5. Let Ash get all kills now (accelerate leveling)

**Vandalier Power Level:**
- Can cast Plasma Wave every turn (damages all enemies)
- Life Orb restores HP/MP for free
- Supreme Healing keeps party alive
- Phase Shift eliminates clusters
- **Essentially unkillable**

---

## The Trials of Toroah

### Requirements for Vandalier

**Must Complete ALL 6 Trials:**
1. ✓ Nova Trial → Nova Prism
2. ✓ Earth Trial → Earth Prism
3. ✓ Mana Trial → Mana Prism
4. ✓ Chaos Trial → Chaos Prism
5. ✓ Logos Trial → Logos Prism
6. ✓ Heaven Trial → Heaven Prism

**Process:**
1. Acquire Key (hidden in specific battles)
2. Equip Key on Ash
3. Visit any Dojo
4. Select "Enter Trial"
5. Complete trial (unique battle)
6. Receive Prism
7. Repeat for all 6 Trials
8. Visit Dojo → Advance to Vandalier

{: .danger }
> **Missing even ONE Prism means Ash cannot become Vandalier!** All 6 are mandatory.

### Trial Difficulty Scaling

**Enemy Level Formula:**
- Trial enemies = Ash's Level ± 2 levels
- If Ash Lv.20 → Enemies Lv.18-22
- If Ash Lv.30 → Enemies Lv.28-32

**Difficulty Comparison:**

| Ash Level | Enemy Level | Difficulty |
|:----------|:------------|:-----------|
| Lv. 15 | Lv. 13-17 | **Manageable** |
| Lv. 20 | Lv. 18-22 | Moderate |
| Lv. 25 | Lv. 23-27 | Challenging |
| Lv. 30 | Lv. 28-32 | **Extremely Hard** |

**Recommendation:**
- Complete Trials when Ash is Lv.15-20
- Dramatically easier than at Lv.25-30
- Heaven Trial (final) at Lv.18-20 is optimal

---

## Combat Strategy

### As Hero/Champion/Paragon

**Standard Battle Role:**
1. **Mid-range positioning** (not front, not back)
2. **Use Rolling Fire on clusters** (3+ enemies)
3. **Sword attacks on singles**
4. **Ice Storm vs armored enemies**
5. **Stay protected** (Game Over if Ash dies!)

**Typical Turn:**
- **Turn 1:** Rolling Fire on enemy cluster (8 MP)
- **Turn 2:** Sword attack on weakened enemy
- **Turn 3:** Ice Storm on armored enemy (4 MP)
- **Turn 4:** Rolling Fire again if MP available
- **Turn 5+:** Conserve MP, use sword attacks

**Priority:**
- Ash's survival > Ash's damage output
- Better to play safe than risk Game Over
- Let Mages (Eleni/Zohar) handle heavy damage
- Ash provides utility and backup damage

### As Vandalier

**Overpowered Battle Strategy:**
1. **Start of battle:** Life Orb effect (free full HP/MP restore)
2. **Round 1:** Plasma Wave (damages ALL enemies, 15 MP)
3. **Round 2:** Plasma Wave again (all enemies critically wounded)
4. **Round 3:** Phase Shift to finish clusters
5. **Round 4:** Salamander if needed
6. **Round 5+:** Spam Plasma Wave until victory

**Why This Is Broken:**
- Plasma Wave hits every enemy for 50-80 damage
- 8 enemies × 60 damage = 480 total damage per cast
- Most efficient spell in game
- Life Orb restores MP for free
- Can cast Plasma Wave 6-10 times per battle
- **Enemies never get to act (dead too quickly)**

{: .note }
> Vandalier Ash can solo most battles. Other characters barely needed.

---

## Boss Battle Strategy

### Pre-Vandalier (Hero/Champion/Paragon)

**Boss Battle Role:**
1. **Survival first** - Don't die (Game Over!)
2. **Steady damage** - Sword attacks + spells
3. **Self-sustain** - Faerie Light/Star if needed
4. **Support role** - Let Mages do heavy damage

**Typical Ash Turns vs Boss:**
- **Physical Attack:** 40-60 damage per hit
- **Delta Mirage:** 50-80 magic damage (10 MP)
- **Rolling Fire:** 40-60 to boss + adds (8 MP)
- Ash contributes but isn't the star

### Post-Vandalier

**Boss Battle Domination:**
1. **Life Orb effect** (free full restore)
2. **Plasma Wave** (boss + all adds take 50-80 damage)
3. **Phase Shift** (finish adds)
4. **Salamander** (more AOE if needed)
5. **Supreme Healing** (heal party if hurt)
6. **Repeat** Plasma Wave until boss dead

**Boss + Adds Scenario:**
- Boss (500 HP) + 6 Adds (80 HP each)
- **Turn 1 Plasma Wave:** Boss takes 60, all 6 adds take 60
- **Turn 2 Plasma Wave:** Boss takes 60 (now 380 HP), adds die
- **Turn 3-8:** Phase Shift, Salamander, finish boss
- Boss defeated in ~5 rounds

{: .important }
> Plasma Wave's ability to damage boss AND all supporting enemies simultaneously makes multi-enemy boss fights trivial.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Overleveling Ash Before Trials
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Common Error:**
- Using Ash heavily in all battles
- "He's the protagonist, he should be strongest!"
- Ash reaches Lv.25-30 before attempting Trials
- Trials become extremely difficult
- **May fail Trials, cannot become Vandalier**

**Why It Fails:**
- Trial enemies scale to Ash's level
- Lv.30 Ash → Lv.28-32 enemies
- Enemies have boss-tier stats at high level
- Near-impossible to complete
- Missing Vandalier = missing strongest class

**Solution:**
- **Keep Ash Lv.15-20** until Trials done
- Use other characters as main damage dealers
- Complete Trials while Ash low-level (easier)
- **THEN power-level Ash after Vandalier**

### Mistake #2: Skipping Trials
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Temptation:**
- "Trials are hard, I'll skip them"
- "8/10 Hero is good enough"
- Not collecting all 6 Keys
- Completing game without Vandalier

**Why It's Terrible:**
- Vandalier is 10/10 (Hero is 8/10)
- Vandalier makes final battles dramatically easier
- Plasma Wave is most powerful spell in game
- Missing ultimate equipment (Vandal Heart)
- **You're playing on hard mode by choice**

**Solution:**
- **Complete ALL 6 Trials** (mandatory for optimal play)
- See [Trials section]({{ site.baseurl }}/trials/) for detailed strategies
- Worth the effort - Vandalier is game-changing

### Mistake #3: Exposing Ash to Danger
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Common Pattern:**
- Positioning Ash on front line
- "He's strong, he can tank"
- Aggressive advancing
- Taking unnecessary risks

**Why It's Dangerous:**
- **Ash dies = Game Over**
- Doesn't matter if winning battle
- One mistake = restart from beginning
- Enemies focus-fire protagonist

**Solution:**
- **Mid/back-line positioning**
- Let Knights tank front line
- Ash supports from 2-4 tiles back
- Better to be cautious than Game Over

### Mistake #4: Not Using Life Orb Effect (Vandalier)
{: .label .label-yellow }
**INEFFICIENT!**

**Common Error:**
- Not realizing Life Orb effect costs 0 MP
- Using it only in emergencies
- Not spamming it every battle
- Running out of MP unnecessarily

**Why It's Bad:**
- Life Orb restores ALL HP and MP
- **COSTS ZERO MP**
- Can use it every single turn
- Free unlimited MP = spam Plasma Wave forever

**Solution:**
- **Use Life Orb effect every battle start**
- Free full HP/MP restore (0 cost)
- Then spam expensive spells (Plasma Wave 15 MP, Supreme Healing 30 MP)
- Run out of MP? Use Life Orb again (still free!)
- **Infinite MP effectively**

---

## Advanced Tactics

### The "Vandalier Rush" Strategy

**Goal:** Get Vandalier as early as possible

**Steps:**
1. **Chapter 1-2:** Keep Ash Lv.10-15 (minimal use)
2. **Chapter 3:** Complete Nova + Earth Trials
3. **Chapter 4:** Complete Mana + Chaos Trials
4. **Chapter 5:** Complete Logos Trial
5. **Chapter 6 early:** Complete Heaven Trial
6. **Immediately become Vandalier**
7. Vandalier Ash steamrolls rest of game

**Benefits:**
- Vandalier for maximum amount of game
- Final battles become trivial
- Can power-level Ash safely post-Vandalier
- Enjoy being OP for longer

### Plasma Wave Spam

**Battle Opening:**
1. Life Orb (free full MP)
2. Plasma Wave (15 MP, all enemies take ~60 damage)
3. Plasma Wave again (15 MP, all enemies take ~60 damage)
4. **Most enemies dead** (took 120 damage)
5. Phase Shift to finish survivors
6. Battle over in 3-4 rounds

**MP Math:**
- Start: 100 MP (after Life Orb)
- Plasma Wave: -15 MP (85 remaining)
- Plasma Wave: -15 MP (70 remaining)
- Phase Shift: -12 MP (58 remaining)
- Still have 58 MP for more spells!

### Supreme Healing + Tank

**Vandalier Ash as Unkillable Tank:**
1. Position Ash on front line (now safe)
2. Ash takes damage from enemies
3. **Cast Supreme Healing** (30 MP, full party heal)
4. Ash back to full HP
5. Cast Plasma Wave (damage all enemies)
6. Repeat

**Result:**
- Ash tanks entire enemy army
- Heals himself and party every 2-3 turns
- Damages all enemies simultaneously
- **Effectively immortal**

**Hero (8/10) vs Archer (8/10):**
- **Hero advantage:** Higher defense, can front-line
- **Archer advantage:** Safer range, no counterattack

**Hero (8/10) vs Priest (9/10):**
- **Priest superior:** Essential healing, party survival
- **Hero advantage:** Offensive damage, versatile
- **Verdict:** Different roles, both needed

**Vandalier (10/10) vs Mage (10/10):**
- **Both rated 10/10:** Highest possible rating
- **Vandalier advantage:** Has EVERYTHING (all spells + physical)
- **Mage advantage:** Available earlier, two mages possible
- **Verdict:** Vandalier slightly better (complete toolkit), but Mages available sooner and in pairs
