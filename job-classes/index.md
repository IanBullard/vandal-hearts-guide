## Class System Overview

Vandal Hearts features a branching class advancement system. Most characters start as basic classes (Soldier, Archer, Mage, or Healer) and can advance at **Level 10** and **Level 20** by visiting a Dojo in any town.

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Advancement | Notes |
|:------|:------------|:------|
| 10 | First Advancement | Choose your path (branching point for some classes) |
| 20 | Second Advancement | Final class evolution |
| 20+ | Multiple Advancements | Can advance multiple times if you have accumulated levels |

{: .note }
> When a character advances, they automatically receive equipment appropriate for their new class!

## Class Ratings & Analysis

### Top Tier Classes
{: .label .label-green }

#### Mage (Sorceror → Enchanter) - 10/10
**Why it's the best**:
- Phase Shift spell makes other classes obsolete
- Salamander ends battles before they start
- Huge range and area of effect
- High damage against all enemy types

{: .important }
> "With the sole exception of the Vandalier, this is far and wide, the strongest class in the entire game." - Jeff Chan

#### Vandalier (Ash Only) - 10/10
**Why it's ultimate**:
- Access to EVERY spell in the game
- Exclusive equipment (best stats)
- Plasma Wave hits all enemies simultaneously
- Life Orb restores full HP/MP for free

#### Priest (Bishop → Archbishop) - 9/10
**Why it's essential**:
- Cannot revive characters during battle - healing is crucial
- Attack and defense buff spells
- Powerful attack magic (not as strong as Mage, but still good)
- Long range keeps them safe

---

### High Tier Classes
{: .label .label-blue }

#### Archer (Bowman → Sniper) - 8/10
**Strengths**:
- Long-range attacks without counterattacks
- Excellent against flying enemies and mages
- Can soften enemies for melee to finish
- Consistent damage

#### Airman (Hawknight → Sky Lord) - 7/10
**Strengths**:
- Excellent mobility (ignore terrain)
- Strong attackers vs ground units
- Not hindered by obstacles or water

**Weakness**:
- Extremely vulnerable to arrows (can die in one hit)

---

### Mid Tier Classes
{: .label .label-yellow }

#### Knight (Swordsman → Duelist) - 6/10
**Role**: Standard physical fighter
- Strong attack and defense
- Good range
- Reliable but unremarkable

{: .note }
> Keep Knights on this path; don't advance to Guardsman!

#### Monk/Ninja - 5/10
**Why it's mediocre**:
- Decent mix of fighting and healing
- Never excels at either role
- Requires giving up better classes (Mage or Priest)

---

### Bottom Tier Classes
{: .label .label-red }

#### Armor (Guardsman → Dragoon) - 1/10
**Why it's the worst**:
- Pathetically slow movement
- Battle ends before they engage
- Vulnerable to mages despite high defense
- Wastes turns trying to reach combat

{: .warning }
> "This is, in my opinion, the worse class in the entire game." - Jeff Chan

**Multiple FAQ authors unanimously agree**: Never advance to this class path!

## Class Distribution Strategy

### Optimal Party Composition

Based on consolidated FAQ recommendations:

│ 2  × Mage (Sorceror → Enchanter)    │
│ 2  × Priest (Bishop → Archbishop)   │
│ 3-4 × Archer (Bowman → Sniper)      │
│ 1-2 × Airman (Hawknight → Sky Lord) │
│ 2-3 × Knight (Swordsman → Duelist)  │
│ 0  × Armor (NEVER!)                 │
│ 0  × Monk (waste of good casters)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
