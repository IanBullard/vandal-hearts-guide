## Overview

{: .warning }
> "Monk class isn't that bad. Actually fairly decent combination of fighter and healer. Though does good job utilizing both attributes, does not excel in either. **Main problem:** To get it, must give up either Mage or Priest class, both of which are better." - Jeff Chan

The **Monk class** is rated 5/10 by FAQ authors - a hybrid healer-fighter that's decent at both roles but excels at neither. The fatal flaw: **obtaining Monk requires sacrificing either Mage (10/10) or Priest (9/10)**, both of which are vastly superior.

Level 1-9          Level 10-19        Level 20+
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
Healer ──────────> Monk ──────────> Ninja

Mage ────────────> Monk ──────────> Ninja
```

### Advancement Levels

| Level | Class | Source | Key Abilities |
|:------|:------|:-------|:--------------|
| 1-9 | **Healer** or **Mage** | Starting class | Healing OR offensive magic |
| 10-19 | **Monk** | From Healer/Mage at Lv.10 | Hybrid healing + attack magic |
| 20+ | **Ninja** | From Monk at Lv.20 | Peak hybrid stats, all spells |

{: .danger }
> **CRITICAL WARNING:** Choosing Monk at Level 10 means **NEVER becoming** Priest (9/10) or Mage (10/10)! This is permanent and irreversible!

## Why Monk is 5/10

### The "Jack of All Trades" Problem

{: .note }
> "Though does good job utilizing both attributes, does not excel in either." - Jeff Chan

**What Monks Can Do:**
- ✓ Heal allies (Healing Circle, Healing Wave)
- ✓ Attack enemies (Stone Shower, Thunder Flash)
- ✓ Buff allies (Perfect Guard, Mystic Energy)
- ✓ Cure status (Cure Wide)

**The Problem:**
- **Healing:** Moderate (never matches Priest's Supreme Healing)
- **Attacking:** Moderate (never matches Mage's Phase Shift/Salamander)
- **Result:** Mediocre at everything, excellent at nothing

### Comparison: Monk vs Specialist Classes

**Monk (5/10) vs Priest (9/10) - HEALING:**

| Aspect | Monk Healing | Priest Healing |
|:-------|:-------------|:---------------|
| **Best Heal** | Healing Wave (10 MP, 0/2 area) | **Supreme Healing (30 MP, infinite range, ENTIRE PARTY)** |
| **Efficiency** | Moderate | Excellent |
| **MP Cost** | High (10-15 MP spells) | Reasonable (3-5 MP standard heals) |
| **Role Focus** | Split (healing + offense) | Pure healing (better at it) |

**Verdict:** Priest healing is **drastically superior**

**Monk (5/10) vs Mage (10/10) - OFFENSE:**

| Aspect | Monk Offense | Mage Offense |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **Best Attack** | Thunder Flash (12 MP, 0/2 area) | **Phase Shift (12 MP, 0/7 area, 2-3x damage)** |
| **AOE Size** | Small (0/2 = 5 tiles) | Massive (0/7 = 25+ tiles) |
| **Damage** | 40-60 per enemy | 80-120 per enemy |
| **Ultimate** | None | **Salamander (0/10 area, 100+ damage)** |

**Verdict:** Mage offense is **overwhelmingly superior**

## Why Only 5/10 (The Fatal Flaw)

### The Opportunity Cost Problem

{: .danger }
> **THE CRITICAL ISSUE:** To get Monk (5/10), you must sacrifice **either**:
> - **Mage (10/10)** - Highest-rated class, walking death machine
> - **Priest (9/10)** - Second-highest rated, essential healer
>
> **This is NEVER worth it!**

**Scenario 1: Healer → Monk**
- **What you gain:** Mediocre offense + mediocre healing (Monk 5/10)
- **What you lose:** Excellent healing + Supreme Healing (Priest 9/10)
- **Net result:** Downgrade from 9/10 to 5/10
- **Math:** You lose 4 points of value

**Scenario 2: Mage → Monk**
- **What you gain:** Mediocre offense + mediocre healing (Monk 5/10)
- **What you lose:** Devastating offense + Phase Shift + Salamander (Mage 10/10)
- **Net result:** Downgrade from 10/10 to 5/10
- **Math:** You lose 5 points of value

{: .important }
> **In both cases, you're trading a top-tier class (9-10/10) for a below-average class (5/10). This is objectively bad.**

### The "Why Not Just Use Both?" Argument

**Player Thinking:**
- "I'll make Huxley a Priest AND Eleni a Monk"
- "That way I have healing + hybrid!"

**Why This Fails:**
- **Better alternative:** Huxley (Priest 9/10) + Eleni (Mage 10/10)
- **Priest:** Excellent healing (9/10)
- **Mage:** Excellent offense (10/10)
- **Monk:** Mediocre at both (5/10)
- **Verdict:** Priest + Mage >> Priest + Monk

**The Math:**
- Priest (9/10) + Mage (10/10) = 19 total value
- Priest (9/10) + Monk (5/10) = 14 total value
- **Loss: 5 points of value**

{: .note }
> "Using Monk for damage not bright when Mage characters so much better. Using over Priest class equally wasteful - cannot compete in healing." - Jeff Chan

## Monk Spell Arsenal

### Monk-Exclusive Spells

| Spell | Type | R/F | Cost | Priority | Notes |
|:------|:-----|:----|:-----|:---------|:------|
| **Stone Shower** | Attack | 0/1 | 10 MP | MEDIUM | Earth damage, small AOE |
| **Cure Wide** | Status | 0/1 | 4 MP | MEDIUM | Remove status, small AOE |
| **Healing Circle** | Heal | 0/1 | 6 MP | HIGH | Heal nearby allies |
| **Perfect Guard** | Buff | 4/0 | 15 MP | LOW | AGL up (expensive!) |
| **Thunder Flash** | Attack | 0/2 | 12 MP | HIGH | Lightning AOE |
| **Healing Wave** | Heal | 0/2 | 10 MP | HIGH | Stronger heal, larger area |
| **Mystic Energy** | Buff | 4/0 | 15 MP | LOW | DEF+ATK up (expensive!) |

### Spell Analysis

**Healing Spells:**
- Healing Circle (6 MP, 0/1) - Decent but small area
- Healing Wave (10 MP, 0/2) - Better but expensive
- **Priest's Supreme Healing:** 30 MP, infinite range, **ENTIRE PARTY**
- **Verdict:** Monk healing is cheap but limited

**Attack Spells:**
- Stone Shower (10 MP, 0/1) - Weak damage, small area
- Thunder Flash (12 MP, 0/2) - Decent damage, moderate area
- **Mage's Phase Shift:** 12 MP, 0/7, **MASSIVE AREA + DAMAGE**
- **Verdict:** Monk offense is weak compared to Mage

**Buff Spells:**
- Perfect Guard (15 MP!) - Too expensive
- Mystic Energy (15 MP!) - Too expensive
- **Priest's buffs:** 3 MP each (much cheaper)
- **Verdict:** Monk buffs not cost-effective

## Strategic Analysis

### When Monk Might Be Considered

**Hypothetical Scenarios:**
1. **If Monk didn't require sacrificing Mage/Priest** - Would be 7/10
2. **If you had 6 Healers and 6 Mages** - Could spare one for Monk
3. **If Priest/Mage didn't exist** - Monk would be excellent

**Reality:**
- Monk DOES require sacrificing Mage/Priest
- You only have 2 Healers and 2 Mages (limited resources)
- Priest/Mage DO exist and are far superior
- **Monk is never optimal choice**

{: .note }
> "If didn't require characters to give up better class, this class might have actually been more useful. But you can't win them all." - Jeff Chan

### The Only Valid Use Case

**Theoretical Scenario:**
- You've already made 2 Priests (Huxley + Sara)
- You've already made 2 Mages (Eleni + Zohar)
- You get a 3rd Healer or 3rd Mage somehow
- **THEN you could make a Monk**

**Problem:**
- This scenario doesn't exist in Vandal Hearts
- Only 2 Healers, only 2 Mages
- **Cannot make Monk without sacrificing**

## Comparison: Optimal vs Monk Parties

### Optimal Party (No Monks)

**Class Distribution:**
- **Ash:** Hero → Champion → Paragon → Vandalier (8-10/10)
- **Clint/Grog/Dolan:** Knight → Swordsman → Duelist (6/10 each)
- **Diego/Kira/Amon/Darius:** 2-3 Archers (8/10) + 1-2 Airmen (7/10)
- **Huxley/Sara:** Priest → Bishop → Archbishop (9/10 each)
- **Eleni/Zohar:** Mage → Sorcerer → Enchanter (10/10 each)

**Total Value:** 1 Hero (8) + 3 Knights (18) + 3 Archers (24) + 1 Airman (7) + 2 Priests (18) + 2 Mages (20) = **95 points**

### Monk Party (1 Monk)

**Class Distribution:**
- **Ash:** Hero (8/10)
- **Clint/Grog/Dolan:** Knights (6/10 each)
- **Diego/Kira/Amon/Darius:** 2-3 Archers + 1-2 Airmen
- **Huxley:** Priest (9/10)
- **Sara:** Monk (5/10) ← Downgrade!
- **Eleni/Zohar:** Mages (10/10 each)

**Total Value:** 1 Hero (8) + 3 Knights (18) + 3 Archers (24) + 1 Airman (7) + 1 Priest (9) + 1 Monk (5) + 2 Mages (20) = **91 points**

**Loss: 4 points of value** (Priest 9 → Monk 5)

> Making even ONE Monk makes your party objectively weaker!

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Making Monk for "Variety"
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Temptation:**
- "I want to try different classes"
- "Hybrid sounds interesting"
- "Let me make one Monk for fun"

**Why It's Bad:**
- Trading 9/10 or 10/10 for 5/10
- **Handicapping yourself deliberately**
- Making game harder for no benefit
- Missing out on Supreme Healing or Phase Shift

**Solution:**
- If you want variety: Make mix of Archers + Airmen
- If you want hybrid: Use Ash (Hero has spells + physical)
- **Don't sacrifice Priest/Mage for Monk**

### Mistake #2: "Monk Has Healing AND Offense"
{: .label .label-red }
**FLAWED LOGIC!**

**Player Reasoning:**
- "Monk does both healing and offense"
- "Two roles in one character = efficient?"
- "More versatile than specialist"

**Why It's Wrong:**
- **Priest healing (9/10) >> Monk healing (5/10)**
- **Mage offense (10/10) >> Monk offense (5/10)**
- Mediocre at two things ≠ excellent at one thing
- **Better to have specialists**

**The Reality:**
- Priest (9/10 healing) + Mage (10/10 offense) = 19 total value
- Monk (5/10 healing + 5/10 offense) = 5 total value
- **Specialists are 3.8x more valuable**

### Mistake #3: "High AGI/Move Makes Up For It"
{: .label .label-yellow }
**INSUFFICIENT!**

**Player Thinking:**
- "Monks have high AGL/MOVE"
- "Better mobility than Priest/Mage"
- "That compensates for weaker spells?"

**Why It Doesn't:**
- Priest doesn't need mobility (casts from range)
- Mage doesn't need mobility (casts from range)
- **High AGI/MOVE doesn't make spells better**
- Healing Wave still << Supreme Healing
- Thunder Flash still << Phase Shift
- **Mobility doesn't fix fundamental weakness**

### Mistake #4: Thinking Ninja Is Worth It
{: .label .label-yellow }
**STILL NOT WORTH!**

**Level 20 Advancement:**
- Monk → Ninja at Level 20
- "Maybe Ninja is good?"

**The Problem:**
- Ninja still has same spells (no improvement)
- Still mediocre healing (no Supreme Healing)
- Still mediocre offense (no Phase Shift/Salamander)
- **Archbishop (Priest Lv.20) >> Ninja**
- **Enchanter (Mage Lv.20) >> Ninja**

**Verdict:** Ninja doesn't fix Monk's problems

## If You Made Monk Anyway (Damage Control)

### Acknowledging the Mistake

{: .warning }
> If you've already made a Monk and can't undo it (no earlier save), here's how to minimize the damage.

### Optimal Monk Usage

**As Hybrid Support:**
1. **Primary Role:** Emergency healing (when Priest busy)
2. **Secondary Role:** Offensive magic (when not healing)
3. **Positioning:** Mid-range (3-4 tiles behind front)

**Spell Priority:**
1. **Healing Wave** (10 MP) - Heal multiple wounded allies
2. **Thunder Flash** (12 MP) - Attack clustered enemies
3. **Cure Wide** (4 MP) - Remove status effects
4. **Healing Circle** (6 MP) - Cheap heal for minor wounds

**Avoid:**
- Perfect Guard (15 MP - too expensive)
- Mystic Energy (15 MP - too expensive)
- Trying to main-heal (Priest better)
- Trying to main-damage (Mage better)

### MP Management

**Monk MP Problem:**
- Spells cost 10-15 MP (expensive!)
- Monk has moderate MP pool
- **Runs out quickly**

**Solutions:**
1. Stock **Mage Gems** (restore 10 MP)
2. Use **Healing Circle** (6 MP) over Healing Wave (10 MP) when possible
3. Conserve MP (don't spam expensive spells)
4. Have Priest use **Magic Charge** on Monk (restore 10 MP)

### Formation Placement

**Optimal Position:**
```
[Knight] [Knight] [Knight]
  [Priest] [Monk] [Mage]
   [Archer] [Archer] [Archer]

Monk in center-middle
Can reach front for healing
Can cast offense on enemies
Protected by formation
```

## Final Verdict

{: .label .label-red }
**NOT RECOMMENDED**

**Why Monk is 5/10:**
- Mediocre healing (never matches Priest)
- Mediocre offense (never matches Mage)
- High MP costs (expensive spells)
- **Fatal flaw:** Must sacrifice Priest (9/10) or Mage (10/10) to obtain

**The Math:**
- **Opportunity Cost:** Sacrifice 9/10 or 10/10 class
- **What You Get:** 5/10 hybrid
- **Net Loss:** 4-5 points of value
- **Verdict:** NEVER worth it

**Recommended:**
- **Make ZERO Monks**
- Keep Huxley/Sara as Priests (9/10)
- Keep Eleni/Zohar as Mages (10/10)
- **Don't handicap yourself**

## The Only Reason to Make Monk

**Valid Reason:**
- You want to challenge yourself with handicapped party
- You enjoy playing on "hard mode"
- You find optimal play boring
- **You understand you're deliberately weakening your party**

**Invalid Reasons:**
- ✗ "Monk is better because hybrid"
- ✗ "I need variety"
- ✗ "Ninja sounds cool"
- ✗ "One Monk won't hurt"

{: .important }
> If you want a challenge run or just enjoy playing sub-optimally for fun, go ahead! But understand: **Making Monk makes game harder by giving up 9/10 or 10/10 class for 5/10 class**.

---

## Next Steps

- **DO:** Read [Priest Class Guide](/job-classes/priest/) to understand what you're sacrificing (9/10)
- **DO:** Read [Mage Class Guide](/job-classes/mage/) to understand what you're sacrificing (10/10)
- **DON'T:** Make Monks in optimal play
- Final guide: [Armor Class](/job-classes/armor/) (1/10 - even worse than Monk!)
