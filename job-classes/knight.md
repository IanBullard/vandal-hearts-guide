## Overview

{: .note }
> "Standard physical fighter. Possesses strong attack, sturdy defense, and good range. Basically your all-around strong class. All in all, pretty standard and unremarkable." - Jeff Chan

The **Knight class** is rated 6/10 by FAQ authors - a solid but unremarkable frontline fighter. Knights aren't bad, they're just... standard. They do exactly what you'd expect: hit things with swords and absorb damage. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Why Knight is 6/10

### The "Standard" Problem

**What Knights Do Well:**
- High ATK → Deal good physical damage
- High DEF → Absorb physical attacks
- Reliable → Always useful in some capacity
- Straightforward → No complexity

**The Issue:**
- **No special abilities** - Just sword attacks
- **No magic** - Physical only
- **No healing** - Can't sustain self
- **No range** - Must be adjacent to attack
- **No AOE** - Single-target only
- **No unique utility** - Nothing special

{: .note }
> "Basically your all-around strong class. All in all, pretty standard and unremarkable." - Jeff Chan

### Outclassed by Other Classes

**Knight (6/10) vs Hero (8/10):**
- Hero = Knight + magic spells + healing
- Knight = Just physical attacks
- **Hero does everything Knight does AND MORE**

**Knight (6/10) vs Archer (8/10):**
- Archer = Ranged, no counterattack risk
- Knight = Melee, takes counterattacks
- **Archers deal damage more safely**

**Knight (6/10) vs Mage (10/10):**
- Mage = Phase Shift eliminates 5 enemies
- Knight = Hits one enemy per turn
- **Mages end battles before Knights reach combat**

**The Verdict:**
- Knights aren't bad
- They're just outperformed by almost every other class
- **Serviceable but unremarkable**

### Why Not Lower Rating?

**Redeeming Qualities:**
1. **Frontline necessity** - Someone must tank front
2. **Reliable damage** - Always deals decent damage
3. **No MP dependency** - Never runs out of resources
4. **Simple to use** - No complexity
5. **Better than Armor** (1/10) - At least mobile

**Rating Breakdown:**
- 1-2/10 = Terrible (Armor class)
- 3-4/10 = Bad
- 5/10 = Below average but usable
- **6/10 = Average, serviceable**
- 7/10+ = Good to excellent

---

## Strategic Analysis

### The Necessary Role

**Why You Need Knights Despite 6/10 Rating:**

**Someone Must Tank Front Line:**
- Battles have enemy melee units
- They will advance toward your party
- **Someone must intercept them**
- If not Knights, then who?

**Options:**
- **Ash (Hero)** - Can tank, but Game Over if he dies
- **Knights** - Designed for tanking, safe to lose
- **Airmen** - Fragile, shouldn't tank
- **Mages/Priests** - Terrible defense, die quickly

**Verdict:** Knights are **best option** for frontline tanking

### The "Anvil" Strategy

**Tactical Principle:**
- **Knights = Anvil** (hold front, absorb attacks)
- **Archers/Mages = Hammer** (deal damage from safety)
- Enemies caught between anvil and hammer

**How It Works:**
1. Knights advance to front
2. Enemies engage Knights (drawn to front)
3. **Archers/Mages shoot from back**
4. Enemies take damage without counterattacking archers
5. Knights finish wounded enemies in melee

**Result:**
- Knights take hits (high DEF, survive)
- Archers/Mages deal safe damage
- **Knights enable archer/mage strategies**

{: .important }
> Knights aren't flashy, but they **enable** the powerful classes (Mages, Archers) to operate safely.

### The Damage Absorption Role

**Knights as Damage Sponges:**
- Enemy physical attack on Knight: 15-25 damage
- Same attack on Mage: 50-80 damage
- Same attack on Priest: 50-80 damage
- Same attack on Archer: 30-50 damage

**Knight Durability:**
- Knights: 120-180 HP, 30-50 DEF
- Can take 6-8 hits before dying
- Mages can take 2-3 hits before dying
- **Knights buy time for Mages to cast spells**

---

## Tactical Applications

### Standard Frontline Formation

**Recommended Setup:**
```
[Clint] [Ash] [Grog]
  [Huxley] [Eleni] [Sara]
   [Diego] [Kira] [Zohar]

Knights form front barrier
Priests/Mages in center (protected)
Archers in back (safe range)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Knights intercept melee enemies
- Enemies focus on Knights (high DEF)
- Back-line deals damage safely
- Priests heal Knights as needed
- **Classic defensive formation**

### Engagement Tactics

**Round 1-2:**
- Knights advance toward enemy
- Position to block enemy advance
- Create wall enemy must go through

**Round 3-5:**
- Enemies engage Knights (melee)
- Knights counterattack (deal damage)
- **Knights take damage** (absorb for team)
- Archers/Mages eliminate enemies from behind

**Round 6+:**
- Knights finish wounded enemies
- Priests heal Knights to full
- Advance to next enemy group
- Repeat

### Fighting Archers

**Knights vs Enemy Archers:**
- Knights take **reduced damage** from archers (type advantage)
- Enemy archer shoots knight: 10-15 damage (minimal)
- Knight reaches archer: 50-60 damage (kills)
- **Knights hard-counter enemy archers**

**Practical Use:**
- Send Knights to engage enemy archers
- Absorb arrow fire (barely hurts)
- Close distance and eliminate archers
- Protect your Mages/Airmen from archer fire

---

## Weaknesses & Counters

### Limited Range

**The Reach Problem:**
- Knights must be **adjacent** to attack (range 1)
- Enemies 2+ tiles away = can't hit
- Must spend turns moving into range
- **Slow to engage**

**Practical Impact:**
- Archers shoot from 4-6 tiles (3-5 turns before Knights reach)
- Mages cast from 4-6 tiles (3-5 turns before Knights reach)
- **Knights arrive late to battles**
- Often enemies already dead (Mages killed them)

{: .note }
> "Spells like Phase Shift and Salamander end battle so quickly, other characters may never get chance to get into fray." - Jeff Chan (about Mages, but applies to Knights too)

### No Special Abilities

**What Knights Cannot Do:**
- ✗ Cast spells (no magic)
- ✗ Heal themselves (no recovery)
- ✗ Attack at range (melee only)
- ✗ Hit multiple enemies (no AOE)
- ✗ Buff allies (no support)
- ✗ Debuff enemies (no utility)

**Result:**
- One-dimensional gameplay
- Just "move and attack"
- No tactical depth
- **Boring but functional**

### Vulnerability to Airmen

**Enemy Airmen vs Knights:**
- Enemy airman attacks knight: **40-60 damage** (type advantage)
- Knight attacks airman: 30-40 damage (normal)
- Airman has range, knight doesn't
- **Airmen counter Knights hard**

**Problem:**
- Enemy airmen fly over Knights
- Attack your back line (Mages/Priests)
- Knights can't reach them (flying)
- Must rely on Archers to shoot them down

### Outpaced by Enemy Mages

**Enemy Mages:**
- Cast Phase Shift on your Knights
- 60-80 damage to all Knights in area
- Knights have average MAG DEF (not good)
- **Knights get wrecked by magic**

**Solution:**
- Use your Archers to kill enemy Mages first
- Knights can't deal with magic effectively
- Need archer/mage support

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Choosing Armor Path at Level 10
{: .label .label-red }
**WRONG!**

**Temptation:**
- "Armor class has even higher DEF!"
- "More tanky = better tank?"
- "Guardsman → Dragoon sounds cool"

**Why It's Terrible:**
- Armor class is rated **1/10** (worst in game)
- Utterly pathetic movement (2 tiles per turn)
- **Never reaches combat** (battles end before arrival)
- High DEF doesn't matter if you never fight
- Completely useless

{: .danger }
> **NEVER choose Armor path!** Always go Swordsman → Duelist! See [Armor Class Guide](/job-classes/armor/) for full explanation of why Armor is 1/10.

### Mistake #2: Advancing Knights Alone
{: .label .label-yellow }
**RISKY!**

**Common Pattern:**
- Knights charge forward alone
- "I'll tank all the enemies!"
- Leave rest of party behind (3-4 tiles back)
- Knights surrounded by 6-8 enemies

**Why It Fails:**
- 6-8 enemies × 20 damage each = 120-160 damage per round
- Knights have 120-180 HP
- **Dead in 1-2 rounds**
- Priests too far away to heal
- Archers/Mages can't support (out of range)

**Solution:**
- **Advance as formation**
- Knights 2-3 tiles ahead
- Priests 2-3 tiles behind Knights (healing range)
- Archers/Mages 4-5 tiles behind (attack range)
- **Coordinated advance**

### Mistake #3: Using Knights as Primary Damage
{: .label .label-yellow }
**INEFFICIENT!**

**Common Approach:**
- "Knights deal good damage, use them to kill"
- Focus on Knight attacks
- Neglect Mages/Archers

**Why It's Suboptimal:**
- Knight damage: 40-60 per turn (one enemy)
- Mage Phase Shift: 60 damage × 5 enemies = 300 total
- Archer focus fire: 25 × 4 archers = 100 damage (one enemy dead)
- **Knights are least efficient damage dealers**

**Solution:**
- **Knights tank and finish wounded enemies**
- **Mages/Archers do primary damage**
- Knights support, don't lead offense

### Mistake #4: Neglecting Equipment Upgrades
{: .label .label-yellow }
**WASTEFUL!**

**Common Error:**
- Upgrading Mage/Archer equipment first
- "They do more damage, prioritize them"
- Knights using outdated armor

**Why It's Bad:**
- Knights take most hits
- Outdated armor = take more damage
- More damage = more healing needed
- More healing = more MP used
- **Inefficient resource management**

**Solution:**
- **Upgrade Knight armor FIRST**
- Reduces incoming damage (prevention)
- Less healing needed (efficiency)
- Then upgrade weapons for damage dealers

## Advanced Tactics

### The "Bait" Strategy

**Using Knights as Bait:**
1. Knight advances to front alone (deliberately)
2. Enemies focus on Knight (drawn to nearest target)
3. **Knight survives** (high DEF)
4. Archers/Mages eliminate enemies safely
5. Priest heals Knight to full
6. Repeat

**Why It Works:**
- Enemy AI targets nearest/most threatening
- Knight is both (front + high HP)
- Enemies waste turns attacking Knight
- **Your damage dealers kill them safely**

### Chokepoint Defense

**Map Control:**
1. Identify narrow passages (1-2 tiles wide)
2. **Position Knights in chokepoint**
3. Enemies must go through Knights (can't go around)
4. Archers/Mages shoot at enemies stuck behind front

**Result:**
- Enemies bottlenecked (can't swarm)
- Only 1-2 enemies attack Knights per turn
- Knights easily survive
- **Force favorable engagements**

### Protecting Priority Targets

**Bodyguard Role:**
1. Identify priority (Eleni/Zohar mage, Huxley priest)
2. **Position Knight adjacent to priority**
3. Enemy approaching priority
4. Knight intercepts (blocks path)

**Result:**
- Enemy must go through Knight first
- Priority target protected
- Buys time for priority to act

---

## Combat Strategy

### Standard Battle Flow

**Rounds 1-3:**
1. Knights advance (move toward enemy)
2. Position to intercept enemy advance
3. Form defensive wall

**Rounds 4-7:**
1. Enemies engage Knights (melee combat)
2. Knights counterattack (chip damage)
3. **Archers/Mages eliminate enemies from behind**
4. Knights finish wounded survivors

**Rounds 8+:**
1. Clean up remaining enemies
2. Knights advance to next group
3. Repeat process

### Typical Knight Turn

**Option A: Engage New Enemy**
- Move adjacent to healthy enemy
- Attack (40-60 damage)
- Enemy counterattacks (take 15-25 damage)
- Net: Damage dealt, minor damage taken

**Option B: Finish Wounded Enemy**
- Move adjacent to wounded enemy (<40 HP)
- Attack (40-60 damage, enemy dies)
- **No counterattack** (enemy dead)
- Net: Kill without taking damage (efficient)

**Option C: Defensive Positioning**
- Move to block enemy path
- Don't attack (no target in range)
- Wait for enemy to engage you
- Counterattack when they attack

---

## Boss Battle Strategy

### Standard Boss Approach

**Knight Role vs Bosses:**
1. **Frontline engagement** - Keep boss occupied
2. **Absorb boss attacks** - High DEF tanks damage
3. **Steady chip damage** - 40-60 per turn adds up
4. Let Mages/Archers do heavy damage (more efficient)

**Typical Knight Turns:**
- **Turns 1-10:** Attack boss each turn (40-60 damage)
- **Total damage:** 400-600 over boss fight
- Not spectacular, but **consistent and reliable**

**Support Role:**
- Keep boss focused on Knights (not Mages)
- Survive boss attacks (high HP/DEF)
- Finish boss when wounded (<100 HP)

### Multi-Boss Battles

**Some bosses have support:**
- Boss + 4-6 elite enemies
- Knights handle supporting enemies
- Mages focus boss

**Why This Works:**
- Knights good at dealing with standard enemies
- Mages better at boss (high damage spells)
- **Division of labor = efficient**

---

## Trial of Toroah Performance

### Standard Performance Across Trials

**Knights in Trials:**
- Reliable frontline throughout
- Consistent but not spectacular
- **Tank damage, chip away at enemies**
- Let Mages do heavy lifting

**Trial-Specific:**
- **Nova Trial:** Standard melee enemies, Knights perform well
- **Chaos Trial:** Golems have high DEF, Knights struggle (use magic)
- **Logos Trial:** Long endurance battle, Knights sustained tanking valuable
- **Heaven Trial:** 28 elite enemies, Knights help but Mages shine

{: .note }
> Knights are serviceable in Trials but not stars. Essential support role.

---

## Comparison: Knight vs Other Classes

**Knight (6/10) vs Hero (8/10):**
- Both melee fighters
- Hero has spells (major advantage)
- **Hero clearly superior**

**Knight (6/10) vs Archer (8/10):**
- Knight = Melee, high DEF
- Archer = Ranged, safe damage
- **Archer more valuable tactically**

**Knight (6/10) vs Airman (7/10):**
- Knight = Ground tank
- Airman = Flying striker
- **Airman more flexible**

**Knight (6/10) vs Priest (9/10):**
- Completely different roles
- Priests essential (healing)
- Knights serviceable (tanking)
- **Both needed, Priest more critical**

**Knight (6/10) vs Armor (1/10):**
- Knight = Mobile, useful
- Armor = Immobile, useless
- **Knight vastly superior** (always choose Knight over Armor!)

## FAQ Authors' Consensus

### Jeff Chan (Atom Edge)
**Rating:** 6/10
**Quote:** "Standard physical fighter. Possesses strong attack, sturdy defense, and good range."
**Assessment:** "All in all, pretty standard and unremarkable."
**Recommendation:** "Probably best to keep all three characters in this class rather than Armor class"

### Syonyx
**Rating:** Moderate tier

## Final Verdict

{: .label .label-yellow }
**SERVICEABLE FRONTLINE**

**Why Knight is 6/10:**
- Solid stats, reliable performance
- **But:** Outclassed by almost every other class
- **But:** No special abilities or utility
