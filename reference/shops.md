## Shopping Strategies

### Gold Management

**Sources of Gold:**
1. **Battle rewards** - 500-2,000G per battle
2. **Treasure chests** - 1,000-5,000G per chest
3. **Money items** - Sell Mithril (5,000G), Gold Axe (4,000G)
4. **Don't waste** - Avoid unnecessary purchases

### Priority System

**Tier 1 (Always Buy First):**
- Weapons for damage dealers (Ash, Fighters, Archers)
- Mage Gems (15-30 total for Trials)
- Arkstaffs for mages (critical for spell power)

**Tier 2 (Buy Next):**
- Armor for front-line tanks (Knights)
- Life Orbs (3-5 minimum)
- Robes for mages

**Tier 3 (If Gold Permits):**
- Helms for everyone
- Holy H2O (party healing)
- Attack items (usually not worth it)

### Budget Planning

**Chapter 1-2:** ~5,000G needed
- Basic equipment upgrades
- Initial Herb/Elixir stock

**Chapter 3-4:** ~20,000G needed
- Item stockpiling
- Begin Mage Gem collection

**Chapter 5:** ~60,000G needed
- Major equipment upgrade (Village 5)
- Heavy Mage Gem stocking (Village 4)

**Chapter 6:** ~200,000G needed
- Final equipment (Village 7) - ~165,000G
- Final item stock - ~35,000G

**Total Game:** ~285,000G needed for optimal play

### Money-Saving Tips

**What NOT to Buy:**
- **Attack items** (Fire Gem, Mood Ring, Aura Gem) - Spells better
- **Duplicate equipment** - One of each type sufficient
- **Low-tier equipment late** - Don't buy Village 2 gear in Chapter 5
- **Armor class weapons** (Spears) - Never make Armor units

**Cost-Effective Choices:**
- **Buy Herbs over Megaherbs** early (cost-effective)
- **Buy Mage Gems late** (need them most for Trials)
- **Share equipment** - Rotate between characters
- **Sell money items immediately** (Mithril, Gold Axe, Bag of Coin)

### Class Advancement Shopping

**Level 10 Advancement:**
- New class = free basic equipment automatically
- Don't need to buy immediately
- Wait until next village (better gear)

**Level 20 Advancement:**
- Same free equipment benefit
- Usually happens near Village 5-6
- Major shopping opportunity
