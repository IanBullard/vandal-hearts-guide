## Background & Story

### The War Orphan

{: .important }
> **Tragic Origin:** Eleni's parents were killed in war, leaving her as an orphan with no known origins.

**Discovery:**
- Found as war orphan 15 years before game starts
- No clues to her origins or family
- No one knew where she came from
- Would remain mystery... until much later

**Adoption:**
- General Magnus Dunbar found and adopted her
- Gave her love, home, and family
- Not blood-related, but deeply bonded
- Magnus hired Huxley Hobbes as her tutor

{: .note }
> **Name Connection:** In the US version, both are "Dunbar." In Japanese, both are "Sorn" - emphasizing family bond despite lack of blood relation.

---

### The Time Loop Mystery

{: .danger }
> **Major Spoiler:** Eleni's true identity is revealed in Chapter 5!

**The Truth:**
- Eleni is actually **Leena** from the past
- Leena = young girl in Frontier Village (Chapter 5)
- **Time travel** caused by Vandal Heart and space/time magic
- Eleni IS the orphan from 15 years ago...
- ...because she traveled back in time and lost her memory

**The Revelation (Chapter 5):**
- Party meets young Leena in Frontier Village
- Leena has uncanny mastery of mystical arts
- Leena quickly befriends Eleni (herself!)
- When Vandal Heart is used, Leena is pulled through time
- Leena becomes the orphan "Eleni" that Magnus found
- **Closed time loop** - Eleni's origin explained

{: .warning }
> **Mind-Bending:** Eleni befriends her younger self without knowing it. The orphan Magnus found 15 years ago was Leena from the future/present.

## Combat Role & Strategy

### Class Progression

**Mage Path:**
- **Lv.1-9:** Mage
- **Lv.10:** Advances to **Sorcerer** or **Monk**
- **Lv.20:** Advances to **Enchanter** or **Ninja**

### Recommended Class Path

{: .note-title }
> Mage Path (Strongly Recommended)
>
> Mage → Sorcerer → Enchanter

**Why Pure Mage:**
- **Rated 10/10** by multiple FAQ authors (highest rating!)
- Devastating area-of-effect spells
- Can eliminate groups of enemies
- Essential for difficult battles
- Monk path wastes her potential

{: .danger }
> **DO NOT go Monk path!** Eleni's strength is powerful magic. The Monk path dilutes this into hybrid healing/magic. Keep her as pure Mage for maximum effectiveness!

## The Time Loop Explained

↓
PRESENT (Game Events):
↓
Eleni (19) travels to Frontier Village → Meets Leena (young girl)
↓
Vandal Heart/Magic causes time rift
↓
Leena pulled back 15 years → Becomes the orphan Magnus found
↓
CLOSED LOOP: Eleni IS Leena, Leena IS Eleni
```

{: .warning }
