## Background Story

Ash Lambert grew up believing he was the son of a traitor. When everyone looked down on him, Clive Beckett helped him for reasons unknown. Despite his deceased father's status, Ash was able to rise to the position of Platoon Leader in the Ishtaria Security Forces.

His skills were so exceptional that his name caught the attention of many, including Kane (Defense Minister Hel Spites' son and commander of the Crimson Guard), who considers Ash a rival that needs to be "dealt with."

### The Truth About His Father

In truth, Ash's father was never a traitor. He sought to safeguard the life of Arris the Sage from an assassination attempt and was labeled a traitor so others could use it as political leverage.

### The Journey Begins

When Ash is sent to investigate the disappearance of General Magnus, one of Ishtaria's most respected war heroes, he uncovers a hidden coup d'état by Hel Spites and Dolf Crowley. He falls victim to the power of the Magic Stone, sending him into Time Limbo.

When he reemerges three years into the future, Hel rules as emperor. Ash leads his allies to correct the state of affairs. During the course of events, Dolf assassinates Hel and usurps power for himself.

With limited options, Ash journeys north to obtain the Vandal Heart, a power capable of pacifying the Flames of Judgement, preparing for his final confrontation to end the madness.

## Strategy & Tips

### Leveling Strategy

{: .warning }
> **For Trial Completion**: Keep Ash as your LOWEST level character until all Trials are complete. Trial enemy levels scale based on Ash's level only.

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Use Ash minimally in battles before completing all Trials
2. Let other characters do the heavy lifting
3. Position Ash safely in the back lines
4. After obtaining all six Prisms, advance to Vandalier and let him dominate

### Combat Usage

**As Hero/Champion/Paragon**:
- Use Ice Storm and Rolling Fire against groups of enemies
- Save Faerie Light/Faerie Star for emergencies
- Position in mid-range (not frontline tank, not back-row support)
- Protect him carefully (his death = game over)

**As Vandalier**:
- Spam Plasma Wave to damage all enemies simultaneously
- Use Life Orb for full party recovery (it's free!)
- Lead from the front - he's nearly indestructible
- Access to enemy-exclusive spells like Kane's Plasma Wave

### Equipment Priorities

1. **Early Game**: Keep him equipped with best available swords and armor
2. **Mid Game**: Balance defense and attack based on positioning
3. **Late Game**: Save best equipment for after Vandalier advancement
