## Character Selection Strategy

{: .important }
> Since you cannot revive fallen characters during battle, choosing the right party composition and keeping everyone alive is crucial.

### Recommended Core Party

Based on multiple FAQ authors' recommendations:

1. **Ash** - Your protagonist (required in all battles)
2. **Eleni** or **Zohar** - Mage for powerful area attacks (Mages rated 10/10)
3. **Huxley** or **Sara** - Healer for support (Priests rated 9/10)
4. **2-3 Archers** - For ranged damage and anti-air (rated 8/10)
5. **1-2 Knights** - For frontline tanking (rated 6/10)

{: .warning }
> **Avoid the Armor class!** Multiple FAQ authors rate Armor/Guardsman as the worst class (1/10) due to poor mobility. Keep Knights on the Duelist path instead.

### Character Synergies

- **Mage + Healer Combo**: Devastating spell damage with consistent healing support
- **Archer Focus**: Multiple archers can eliminate threats before they reach your party
- **Hawknight Mobility**: At least one flying unit helps with map traversal and flanking
