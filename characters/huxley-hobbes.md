## Combat Role & Strategy

### Class Progression

### Recommended Class Path

{: .note-title }
> Priest Path (Strongly Recommended)
>
> Healer → Bishop → Archbishop

**Why Pure Priest:**
- **Rated 9/10** by FAQ authors (second-highest rating!)
- Essential healing and support magic
- Supreme Healing at high levels
